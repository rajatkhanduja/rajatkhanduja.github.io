  <li><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/facebook-slingshot/">Facebook’s Slingshot challenges SnapChat with ‘Reply to Unlock’</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook’s new app <a href="http://www.sling.me/">Slingshot</a> is being seen as a 
competitor to SnapChat. </li>
      <li>It lets you share photos and 15-second videos with users on Slingshot.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The content is meant to be ephemeral, much like SnapChat. </p>

        <blockquote><p>As for what happens to your content, once everyone you’ve slinged something to views it, Facebook says it will delete the photo or video from its servers. There is a seven-day delay in case it has to investigate abuse reports, but the team says the content is gone after that. Whether users trust Facebook to keep its word is up to them. Past privacy missteps might scare people, but Facebook is under close scrutiny from the FTC to abide by the privacy policies it puts forward.</p></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>An important catch in the app is that you can’t view the content shared 
by the user until you reply to it. (‘Reply to Unlock’)</li>
      <li>This aims to increase reciprocation and make everyone a content generator.</li>
      <li>Slingshot was born out of a hackathon. The motivation can be summarized by 
        <blockquote><p>“My brothers are really not technical in any way”, Slingshot inventor and four-year Facebook Product Designer Joey Flynn tells me. “I’d take a photo, upload it in iMessage, and send it to them. And I would just see “Seen”, or in a month I’d see them and they‘d say ‘that was a cool photo’. But hey, I want to see what you’re up to! There was this missing reciprocation” he explains. That was the spark for Slingshot.</p></blockquote>
      </li>
      <li>This app was <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/09/slingshot-app/">earlier released on app stored by mistake</a></li>
      <li>Facebook had tried to buy off SnapChat, but <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/us-facebook-snapchat-idUSBRE9AC11E20131113">SnapChat had rejected the $3 billion buyout offer</a></li>

    <p><strong><a href="http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/">Browser based javascript cryptography considered harmful</a></strong></p>

    <p>Some of the things pointed out in the article. <em>[Not being an expert in cryptography, I would recommend readers to read
   the original article to avoid any miscommunication]</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code could be injected when in transit. Can use SSL/TLS to avoid that, but 
then, in most cases, you could simply avoid cryptography at 
user end.</li>
      <li>There’s no certainty of information being removed from memory.</li>
      <li>It is not possible to verify the code/environment to be exactly as it is 
required to be. </li>
      <li>Javascript lacks a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). </li>
      <li><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/">Stanford Javascript Crypto library (SJCL)</a>
developed at Stanford is a great work, but still insecure.
        <blockquote><p>The authors of SJCL themselves say, &#8220;Unfortunately, this is not as great as in desktop applications because it is not feasible to completely protect against code injection, malicious servers and side-channel attacks.&#8221; That last example is a killer: what they&#8217;re really saying is, &#8220;we don&#8217;t know enough about Javascript runtimes to know whether we can securely host cryptography on them&#8221;. Again, that&#8217;s painful-but-tolerable in a server-side application, where you can always call out to native code as a workaround. It&#8217;s death to a browser.</p></blockquote>

residents’ Facebook and Google
use</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret policy define UK residents’ communication on Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.
as ‘external communication’ because they use platforms based in the US, even
if the communication is between two people in the UK.</li>
      <li>This grants the secret services to indiscriminately intercept communication
on these platforms.</li>
      <li>For an ‘internal communication’, a warrant would be required, however that 
is not the case with ‘external communication’.
        <blockquote><p>The Government believes that, even when privacy violations happen, it is not an “active intrusion” because the analyst reading or listening to an individual’s communication will inevitably forget about it anyway.</p></blockquote>

 -
    <blockquote><p>So what exactly is Parastructure? According to the company’s LinkedIn profile, and its (now-offline) home page, it builds “beautiful data analysis software powered by cutting-edge open source infrastructure.” Parastructure’s GitHub pages give some clues as to what that data-analysis software was tackling, with areas covering Spark for cluster computing; Phoenix, a SQL skin over HBase; CrunchBase; and so on</p></blockquote>

    <ul>
      <li>The acquisition was done quite stealthily.</li>
      <li>Probably, Dropbox requires the software and the team to analyze its data</li>
      <li>Parastructure was an enterprise oriented startup and its acquisition indicates 
Dropbox’s intention on strengthening their image as an enterprise product.</li>
      <li>Dropbox’s increased effort in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business">Dropbox for
Business</a> brings it in direct
competition with Box, which is currently leading as an enterprise
solution.</li>
      <li>Both the companies are quite aggressively acquiring companies. </li>
      <li>In fact, Parastructure was acquired on the same day as

      <li>Since the unveiling of iPhone, 7 years ago, not much has changed in how 
we interact with touchscreens.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Qeexo has developed a touchscreen technology capable of detecting difference
between a fingertip, a knuckle, fingernail and a stylus.</p>

        <blockquote><p>Today, FingerSense uses the standard accelerometer in a mobile device to pick up on the vibration patterns different parts of the hand produce when they come in contact with a touchscreen. The FingerSense machine-learning engine understands what part of the finger is touching the screen and triggers a correlated action. For instance, tapping a block of text with your knuckle could trigger the copy and paste menu to appear. To select text, you’d simply drag your knuckle down the text,much like you would a desktop mouse.</p></blockquote>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Due to the lack of an official <a href="https://evernote.com">Evernote</a> client for
Linux and dissatisfied with solutions like
<a href="https://github.com/nvbn/everpad">Neverpad</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/nevernote/">NixNote (formerly
Nevernote)</a>, I have started working
on <a href="https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/Evernote-for-linux">my own Linux client</a>.</p>

<p>It was while developing this that I learned that <a href="https://github.com/evernote/evernote-sdk-cpp">Evernote SDK for
C++</a> doesn’t really provide any
integration with OAuth. I couldn’t even find a well formed solution for the
same on the Internet, except some forum posts suggesting using any available
OAuth 1.0 client. Searching for OAuth clients for C++, I found
<a href="https://github.com/pipacs/o2">O2</a>.  Using this, I was able to create a simple
OAuth integration for Evernote. </p>

<p>Here are the steps :-</p>

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>In an <a href="/techblog/2014/03/12/hasjob-plus-docspad/">earlier post</a>, I had
discussed how I integrated <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad API</a> with
<a href="http://hasjob.co">Hasjob</a>.  As there was no Docspad SDK at that time, its
absence made me realize their importance. Having to deal with raw API calls,
these were the primary problems that I faced, which I thought could be resolved
by a Software Development Kit (SDK) :-</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API lets me talk to your tool, but not in my language</strong></p>

    <p>Say I am developing in Python and I have a dictionary of parameters explaining 
 all that I need the API to do, but the API doesn’t understand the dictionary!
 I would need to convert all those parameters and variables in GET/POST variables
 that before I can get the task done. Moreover, the conventions in your API
 might be extremely different from those of my project, making things worse.</p>

    <p>Certainly, I could work around that by wrapping around your API, which brings
 me to the next point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Managing network calls and errors is annoying</strong></p>

    <p>There are API errors and then there are network/connection errors, timeouts
 and what not. The last thing I need when dealing with a project idea is to
 get stuck understanding what an error code means. SDKs not only help translate
 the content in the developer’s language, but also the errors. An exception
 that describes the error makes it easy for the developer to handle
 certain edge cases without the program blowing up in the users’ face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SDKs provide code samples</strong></p>

    <p>Even if a developer doesn’t need the entire SDK, either because he only
 requires to make a few calls to the API or he/she does not think the SDK
 interacts well with his tool, an openly available SDK still provides code
 samples to the developer to help him/her manage basic things. Be it managing
 errors or creating request URLs, SDKs can act as a good demonstration of how
 the APIs must be used.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sniketh">Niketh</a> had already been planning to release SDKs
himself, so when I suggested it to him, he was eager to get started! Soon

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>About two months ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/sniketh">Niketh</a> came up with an idea
to augment the job application process on <a href="https://hasjob.co">Hasjob</a>.  Having
made the quite awesome product, <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad</a> for handling
documents in web applications, he certainly noticed the lack of the option to
let a job applicant upload a CV while applying through Hasjob. While the user
could add details about himself/herself in a text field, nothing tells as much
about an applicant as a personalized CV. As the <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob">code for the website is open
sourced</a> and written in Python, I took this
opportunity to check out the <a href="http://docspad.com/documentation/gettingstarted">Docspad
APIs</a> and spend a weekend
contributing to a Python based open source project! </p>

<p>But before I dive into the task and the experience, let’s first discuss more about 
Hasjob and Docspad.</p>

<p>Hasjob is <a href="http://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a>’s job board. Hasgeek, based out of
Bangalore, is known for organizing technology events for geeks and developers
in India. Some of these events include Hackathons and
<a href="https://hacknight.in">Hacknights</a>, which are loved among the geeks. HasGeek
lives up to its name by providing the source code to their website and its
components under open source licenses on <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>With the goal of making digital content more accessible, Niketh and
<a href="https://twitter.com/bandiaditya">Aditya</a> founded <a href="http://bookpad.in">Bookpad</a>
(<a href="http://twitter.com/bookpadinc">@bookpadinc</a>). <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad</a> is
their first product, which provides an easy solution for developers to make
applications with document handling capabilities. The set of APIs make it easy
for a developer to provide users with the option to upload and view documents
through the web browser on any device ranging from mobile to desktop.

	<div class="entry-content" itemprop="articleBody">
		<p>Finally, the site is up and ready! Now, all that remains is for me to make all 
this effort worthwhile and start blogging regularly. </p>

<p>The experience of setting up this blog, however, taught me a lot of things. Not 
just the lessons required to setup <a href="http://octopress.org">Octopress</a> or this
particular theme (<a href="https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/">Greyshade</a>) or 
the DNS, but …. oh, who am I kidding, that’s the set of things I gained out of 
this entire experience. But they are not really worth sharing, except probably
the incident where I ended up with an infinite loop of URL redirection because
of an error in configuring the DNS! </p>

<p>So, this post will be less about the hows, but whys! Why did I choose Octopress
(and Greyshade) and why do I expect this to be a good choice? That’s the question
I will focus on. </p>

		<p>Now that I have a domain of my own and <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>
are a good way to write and maintain a blog, I am trying to make a shift to
Octopress based blogging. While I maintain (if 8-13 months of inactivity counts
as maintaining) two blogs, <a href="http://blog.rajatkhanduja.com">Outlet</a> and 
<a href="http://techblog.rajatkhanduja.com">Technical Outlet</a>, I would be dropping the 
latter and shifting here. </p>

<p>At the time of writing this article, I do have certain projects that I would
like to write about.
