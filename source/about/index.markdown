I am a graduate in Computer Science and Engineering from
[Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati (IIT Guwahati)](http://iitg.ac.in)
currently working as a Software Engineer @ [Media.net](http://media.net)
([Directi](http://directi.com)).

Geek. Procrastinator. A polyglot programmer who enjoys *most* of the development 
task. ML enthusiast. Linux user and fan. An avid reader.

## About this blog

Discontinuing my older [blog](http://techblog.rajatkhanduja.com), I would be using this
blog to report, chronicle and discuss my experiences with programming, computers
and mathematics. 

This blog uses [Octopress](https://github.com/imathis/octopress) with [Greyshade theme](https://github.com/shashankmehta/greyshade/)
