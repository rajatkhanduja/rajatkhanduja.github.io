Perhaps a better title for this post would be "Back from the dead"! I was so
lost in my own blog setup, that I couldn't help but wonder if it was really a good
idea to [use Octopress in the first place]({% post_url 2014-03-10-migrating-to-octopress%}). 
Finally, I got around to writing this post, but not without having to check the
[Octopress
documentation](http://octopress.org/docs/blogging/)! 

Anyway, now that I am back here, I intend to write more often. In fact, that's
one of my new year resolutions! But I get ahead of myself. Before I go on to
commit to some goals for this year (as I should have done soon after reading
[The Motivation Hacker]() in 2014), I'd like to review the last year. Before any one blames me of 'plagiarism', I'd like to give credit, where credit is due. This format of reviews is highly inspired by some other similar 
[review posts](https://vickychijwani.me/2016-year-in-review/) I have [come across](https://vickychijwani.me/2014-year-in-review/) [over the years](https://prakhar.me/articles/2014-year-in-review/)

2017 : What all happened!
----------
The year was a peculiar, to say the least. I failed terribly on all my goals (except one). Here are the goals (however vauge) and what I achieved :-

1. **Read 15 books** (The only goal I managed to achieve)

   In fact, [I read 16 books](https://www.goodreads.com/user_challenges/7019921)! (Where would I be without Goodreads to track my progress on such goals). Looking back at that list, I feel good about covering different kinds of books. While 
1. **1 project per month**
    
   Towards the end of 2016, I had come across the interesting idea of resolving
   to ship [1 project every month for the entire
   year](https://blog.1ppm.club/12-months-12-side-projects-are-you-in-c395dbcd648e).
   Although I didn't end up joining the club, or fully committed to the idea, I
   had hoped to make good progress keeping that average in mind. I failed
   miserably.  Although I started well on 
   [Pigit](https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/pigit), my interest soon fizzled
   out. I guess, that's truly the reason why you should commit to such goals
   publicly. My Github commits were pretty low as well.

1. **Run 1000 km**

   As you can see in the image below, I barely managed to achieve 40% of the goal,
   ~100km of which came in December!

Looking at just the goals, it would appear that 2017 turned out to be quite an
unproductive year. However, it was not all that bad. Yes, I failed to do a lot
of the things I had expected to do, but that was also because things drastically
changed over the year. 

1. [InLogg got acquired by Myntra!](http://www.thehindu.com/business/Industry/myntra-acquires-inlogg/article18143405.ece)
   
   Towards the end of 2015, I joined Preeti, Prateek and Hemant to build and 
   grow InLogg! Early 2017, Myntra acquired InLogg and I joined them as a
   Technical Lead.

1. Later in the year, however, I moved to London to work as a Software Engineer
   at Facebook! 


Goals for 2018
------------

Having quickly glossed over the missed goals last year, it's time to establish (and 
start working on) the goals for 2018.  Unlike previous years, this would act 
as the public declaration that I couldn't later deny (for anyone in doubt,
you could track this history of this file on Github)

- **Run 1000 km** (100)

  You can track my progress on [Garmin
  Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/modern/profile/eea59256-a5cd-4d40-aa0c-72577a0c9308)
  
  I use my [Garmin VivoActive HR](https://buy.garmin.com/en-GB/GB/p/538374)
  (since Jun'17) to log my runs. However, I also sync my runs to
  [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/6961634) and
  [Runkeeper](https://runkeeper.com/user/rajatkhanduja/profile?goalId=azziv&)
  using [Tapiriik](http://tapiriik.com/)

- **Read 20 books** (50)
  
  [Goal on Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/challenges/7501-2018-reading-challenge)

- **Write at least one blog post every month** (20)
  
  This post is the first in that series (and now you know why a post about new
  year resolutions comes towards the end of 2018).

The numbers in parenthesis after every goal (totalling to 170) is the amount (in GBP)
that I'd donate to a charity if I fail to meet that goal.
