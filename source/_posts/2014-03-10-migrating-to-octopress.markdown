Now that I have a domain of my own and [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/)
are a good way to write and maintain a blog, I am trying to make a shift to
Octopress based blogging. While I maintain (if 8-13 months of inactivity counts
as maintaining) two blogs, [Outlet](http://blog.rajatkhanduja.com) and 
[Technical Outlet](http://techblog.rajatkhanduja.com), I would be dropping the 
latter and shifting here. 

At the time of writing this article, I do have certain projects that I would
like to write about. 

1. **Integrating [Docspad](http://docspad.com) with [HasJob](http://hasjob.co)** 

    More on this soon. Meanwhile, here's the 
    [pull request](https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob/pull/81) for the same.

2. **[Docspad Python SDK](https://github.com/Bookpad/docspad-sdk-python)** 

    While working on the [HasJob code](https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob), the
    need for such SDKs (more will follow) became clear. 

3. **[Android based Webcomics Reader](https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/WebComics)** 

    As an avid Webcomics fan (my favorites being [XKCD](http://xkcd.com) and
    [SMBC](http://smbc-comics.com), my first attempt at making an Android
    application revolves around the idea of making a single app for my favorite
    webcomics.  

4. **[Zero Knowledge Documents](https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/ZeroKnowledgeDocuments/)**

    While I have not made any improvements up on the basic tool in a long time,
    it has served my purpose well enough for now. 

But more on these topics later for now I have to go through the painful process
of setting up a blog. No offence to any of the developers or contributors of 
Octopress, but any such setup is painful, only the magnitude varies. It has
certainly been easy so far to get up and running, but there are several things
I'd want on the site. Let's see how that goes about. Maybe, this could be the
subject of yet another post. 

Here's hoping for a better blogging future. 

Cheers!
