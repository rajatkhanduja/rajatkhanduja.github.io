  <li><a name="android-one"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/android-one/">Google Introduces Android One Program To Bring More Smartphones To Developing Markets</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>After sharing that Google now has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-now-has-1b-active-android-users/">1 billion 30-day active
users</a>
Sundar Pichai announced the Android One program which would help increase
the number significantly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This initiative will target OEMs, specifically in emerging markets, to make
smartphones more affordable to develop and release.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>With Android One, Google is hoping to reduce the cost of smartphone development by identifying the components that go into a smartphone and to pre-qualify suppliers for those parts to ensure they work together.</p></p><p>        <p>On the software side, Google is giving hardware manufacturers access to its Play Store to help them add locally relevant apps to their devices. It’s also handling all the software updates automatically, just like it does for Nexus devices.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Three OEMs to start with : Cromax, Karbonn and Spice.</li>
      <li>Google is also trying to work with wireless providers to provide low cost
wireless plans.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="material-design"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-unveils-new-cross-platform-design-language-material-design/">Google Unveils New Cross Platform Design Language “Material Design”</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>As a part of the forthcoming, Android ‘L’ release of the Android OS, Google
announced a new universal design language, “Material Design”.
<blockquote><p>“We imagined… what if pixels didn’t just have color, but also depth? What if there was a material that could change its texture? This lead us to something we call ‘material design,” says Matias Durate, Director of Android operating system User Experience at Google…</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>The new framework is now <a href="http://www.google.com/design/">publicly available</a>.</li>
      <li>They aim is to put the framework out in the public to help create a consistent
user-experience for the different Android apps, much like Apple’s guidelines
for Mac and iOS developers.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Redesigned versions of their flagship products like GMail and Calendar will
soon be introduced (for both Android and web)
<blockquote><p>Google describes the new design as being “inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.”</p></p><p>        <p>The design uses familiar tactile means of interacting with its many parts, with visual cues that are grounded in reality, Google says. Its elements also recall print-based design typography, with “deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic interface that immerses the user in the experience.”</p></p><p>        <p>Motion is another key element of the design, but is meant to be. “Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity,” Google adds.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Such a design centric update to Android was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/19/a-sneak-peek-into-androids-future/">expected</a>
and several websites reported the internal project <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/06/11/exclusive-quantum-paper-and-googles-upcoming-effort-to-make-consistent-ui-simple/">‘Quantum’</a></li>
      <li>This move seems to show Google’s increased focus on user-experience and design, 
which seems to have been a distinguishing factor between iOS and Android devices.</li>
    </ul>

  <li><a name="login"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-makes-phone-logins-easier-with-personal-login-feature-for-android-l/">Google Makes Phone Logins Easier With Personal Login Feature For Android ‘L’</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Google demoed a feature that allows the user to skip logging into the phone
as the phone deduces if it is in a trusted environment.</li>
      <li>The phone looks for <em>your</em> smartphone or your Wifi network; if found, it 
doesn’t require you to authenticate yourself through a PIN or pattern.</li>
      <li>In case it senses an unknown/untrusted environment, the PIN/pattern based
login is used. </li>
      <li>This seems to be aimed at competing with Apple’s built-in fingerprint scanner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="android-wear"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-launches-full-android-wear-sdk-lets-developers-create-custom-uis-and-access-sensors/">Android Wear Smartwatches and SDK</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>After announcing that <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/the-first-android-wear-smartwatches-will-go-on-sale-today/">LG’s and Samsung’s first Android Wear Smartphone
watches will go on sale
immediately</a>,
Google announced that it will be releasing <a href="http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html">Android Wear SDK for
developers</a> to build upon.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>… Google demoed several Android Wear functions that will be available on all Android Wear devices including swiping to dismiss messages and displaying contextual information relevant to the wearer.</p></blockquote></p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/0xQ3y902DEQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>On stage, there was also an interesting demo of how the smartwatch showed
contextually relevant information. 
        <ul>
          <li>The wearer had a flight ticket for that day, which was displayed on the watch, like a Google Now card. </li>
          <li>One could see more information by tapping on it.</li>
          <li>An incoming message (on the phone) notification was shown on the watch and swiping it 
away also removed the notification from the phone.</li>
          <li>It was also able to give directions to a place and log/display the number
of steps taken by the wearer.</li>
          <li>Also, it was able to respond to voice commands like searching, responding
to a message and setting an alarm.</li>
        </ul>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/s_LYIQwwQVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The SDK allows developers to create custom UI, allowing their apps to 
leverage the sensors, taps and voice commands on the smartwatches.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The company demoed an app from Eat24, for example, which would allow you to order a pizza from the watch within 30 seconds and just a few taps.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Besides LG and Samsung, they have some other partners. Moto 360 is expected
later this year. Other partners include Asus, Qualcomm, Intel and HTC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Android Wear, for style, supports both square and round shaped watches. 
LG and Samsung’s first watches are square-shaped, while Moto360, will
be round shaped.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="android-tv"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-introduces-android-tv-its-new-platform-for-smart-tv-apps-and-navigation/">Google Introduces Android TV, Its New Platform For Smart TV Apps And Navigation</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Referring to it as the ‘biggest screen in the house’, Google announced 
a new <a href="http://www.android.com/tv/">Android TV operating system</a>.</li>
      <li>It’s software (OS) that will be embedded into smart televisions by 
third party OEMs, much like the Android OS was used by smartphone
manufacturers</li>
      <li>Android TV will work with a number of chipsets and is designed to enable
developers to create apps using the same Android toolset they used for
phones and tablets.</li>
      <li>Android TV will play movies and TV shows and could be controlled by
phones, tablets and even smartwatches.</li>
      <li>Your smartphone or tablet could act as the controller for games played on
Android TV.</li>
      <li>It will have full Chromecast support, which itself received significant
updates, allowing users to beam content from their mobile devices to
their TV.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time Google is trying to enter the TV market. Earlier
attempts, including Google TV, didn’t succeed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="android-auto"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-announces-android-auto-promises-enabled-cars-by-end-of-2014/">Google Announces Android Auto, Promises Enabled Cars By The End Of 2014</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Lately, a lot of road accidents have been attributed to drivers fumbling 
with their phones. With the intention to change this and allow user to 
leverage the power of Android without losing sight of the road, Google
announced <a href="http://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a></li>
      <li>Android-auto connects the user’s smartphone with the car, to provide 
context based information, navigation and notifications on a large-enough
screen on the dashboard.</li>
      <li>The user can interact with it using voice commands or keys on the steering.
While the touch based navigation still works, it’s not as bad as dealing
with the small screen of the phone.</li>
      <li>During the demo, they showed how a driver could start navigation to a 
destination through just voice commands. </li>
      <li>Integration with Google Now allows Android-auto to read your text messages 
out loud to you while you are driving and allows you to dictate and 
send a reply.</li>
      <li>25 car manufacturers have promised to build Android-Auto powered cars
and the first cars are expected to roll out by the end of this year.</li>
      <li>Android Auto SDK will be released soon.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="deep-link"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-blurs-the-line-between-web-and-native-apps-on-android/">Google Blurs The Line Between Web And Native Apps On Android</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Google demoed the new version of Chrome for the next Android version (Android ‘L’).
<blockquote><p>But it isn’t just a better version of Chrome. There is a clear and more profound message coming from Google. The company wants to blend native apps with web tabs. And the end of native apps as we know them could be closer than we might think.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>App switcher now looks like Safari on iOS, with recent apps looking like
cards in a drawer.
<img class="center" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_00391.jpg?w=738" title="‘New app switcher’" ></li>
      <li>Each tab in Chrome gets is shown like a separate app!</li>
      <li>
        <p>Google has already been supporting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/31/android-4-4-kitkat-app-indexing/">deep-links to other
applications</a>
through search results. For instance, if you searched for a book on Google Now,
the search result that links to Goodreads, could actually launched the
Goodreads app, letting you leverage the interface designed by Goodreads
for mobile. They are now expanding this feature to many more apps.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Knowing all this, imagine for a second what Android L will look like. You turn on your phone, search for something in Google using voice search on your home screen. It launches Chrome. You tap on the first search result, it launches a native app. You switch apps to read this article you found earlier in Chrome.</p></p><p>        <p>Back, and forth, and back, and forth between the web and native apps. After a while, you won’t even notice if you’re on the web or in a native app.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Google is possibly doing this because it has been traditionally centered
around web with most of its revenue coming from ads. </li>
      <li>It could be possible that in the future Google tries to make Android
a very thin OS layer letting all the apps be web-based. This would be 
something like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Mozilla’s FirefoxOS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">Palm’s WebOS</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="android-app-chrome"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-will-soon-bring-android-apps-to-chrome-os/">Google will soon bring Android apps to Chrome OS</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The Android apps will essentially run in an emulator on the Chrome OS
Desktop and will be available in the launcher.</li>
      <li>No expected time was given for this feature, however, they did demo a
few apps (eg: Evernote) to show how it would work.</li>
      <li>They also seem to be looking at a tighter integration of Chrome OS and
Android. 
        <ul>
          <li>If you come close to your Chromebook with your phone, it will 
automatically log you in, skipping the authentication step.</li>
          <li>This is quite like the smartwatch unlocking your Android phone.</li>
          <li>Also, the notifications on your Android phone would be available on 
Chromebook as desktop notifications. Currently, this is possible
to achieve using a combination of app on Android and extension on
Google Chrome. <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>, too,
provides this feature.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="chromecast"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/chromecast-update-introduces-an-airplay-like-android-mirroring-feature-photo-backdrops-and-more/">Chromecast Update Introduces An AirPlay-Like Android Mirroring Feature, Photo Backdrops And More</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/index.html">Chromecast</a>,
Google’s popular $35 dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port, letting
you stream video and music to your television, received a number of
updates. </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new feature allows anyone to share the screen without the hassle of 
logging onto the same wifi network as the Chromecast enabled television.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“So how do we do that?,” asks Chandra. “We’re using a variety of technologies to confirm that you’re in the same room as the Chromecast. If for some reason we can’t automatically detect that, you can enter an on-screen PIN,” he explains.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>This would make it more convenient for some guest to share photos or 
videos on the TV.</li>
      <li>Another feature, Backdrop, lets you turn ‘the biggest screen’ in the house
into a photo frame of sorts when it is not being used otherwise.</li>
      <li>It lets you slide through your own photo albums (on Google+) or a random
set of images showing scenic landscapes, art, lifestyle, etc.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The Chromecast app on your mobile could be used to learn more about 
the images on screen (in case you like the image or want to know more
about it).</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>However, the standout feature in the Chromecast update is its new ability to allow any Android device to be mirrored, wirelessly, onto a TV. Google built its own framework for this, allowing it to cut down on the latency, Chandra said.<br/>During the demo, the company showed how you can switch this feature on from the settings, making everything on your phone immediately appear on the TV, including things like Google Earth and even your phone’s camera viewfinder – the latter which was aimed at the audience for a little frivolity before wrapping up the announcement.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Google announced a new addition to its <a href="https://cloud.google.com/">Cloud
Platform</a>, Data
Flow</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service for creating data pipelines that ingest, transform and analyze data in both batch and streaming modes. Cloud Dataflow is a successor to MapReduce, and is based on our internal technologies like Flume and MillWheel. </p></p><p>        <p>Cloud Dataflow makes it easy for you to get actionable insights from your data while lowering operational costs without the hassles of deploying, maintaining or scaling infrastructure. You can use Cloud Dataflow for use cases like ETL, batch data processing and streaming analytics, and it will automatically optimize, deploy and manage the code and resources required.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>Cloud montoring:
        <ul>
          <li>A monitoring tool to find and fix unusual behavior across your 
application stack.</li>
          <li>It provides metrics, dashboards and alerting for Google Cloud Platform
and several popular services like Apache, Nginx, MySQL, etc.</li>
          <li>Google’s earlier acquisition of <a href="https://www.stackdriver.com/">Stackdriver</a> 
could have enabled them to integrate their monitoring tool to create
this.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Cloud Trace and Cloud Debugger provide tools to debug and find performance
bottlenecks in a live application. </li>
      <li>In the demo at I/O, they set a watchpoint in a live application to
to debug a ‘live call’. </li>
      <li>
        <p>Google Cloud Save provides a simple API to developers for saving, retrieving
 and synchronizing user data on the cloud and across devices without the
 need of any server code.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Most of these services are still in private beta and will be launched 
soon</li>

        <p>Google Fit will be a set of APIs that will allow developers to sync data
across wearables and devices.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The dream here is the bundling of user fitness data, with the user’s permission, of course. And Google is not alone in this aspiration, with Apple’s HealthKit platform among the many products aiming to aggregate your health zeros and ones.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>The SDK will roll out in a couple of weeks</li>
      <li>They already have partnered with brands to provide integration with

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://nest.com/works-with-nest">Works with Nest</a> is a program where
Nest (as an independent entity under Google) is allowing developers to
use Nest’s APIs to convey information to Nest and help create a ‘smart
home’ or ‘internet of things’. This video gives a good insight into their
vision and the direction they are headed.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bPdltu-93pM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>Several big names have associated with the program already
        <ul>
          <li>Mercedes-Benz
<blockquote><p>Your car can tell Nest when you’ll be home so your thermostat can start heating or cooling at exactly the right time. It keeps you from wasting energy, and means you’re comfortable as soon as you walk in the door.</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>
            <p>Whirlpool</p>

            <p><blockquote><p>If your Nest Thermostat notices you’re away, it can have Whirlpool switch to a refresh mode when your cycle ends, so your clothes stay fresh and wrinkle-free<br/>…<br/>If you’re signed up for Rush Hour Rewards with a participating energy provider, Nest can let Whirlpool know when an energy rush hour is about to happen, and your washer or dryer will delay the start of the cycle until the rush hour is over</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Charmberlain (garage automation)
<blockquote><p>Open the garage when you arrive, and Chamberlain can tell Nest you’re home. Close it on your way out, and your thermostat can go into Away mode so you don’t waste energy heating or cooling an empty home.</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>IFTTT
<blockquote><p>Create your own connections with one simple statement – “if this then that.” For example, “If my Nest Protect detects smoke, then send a text message to my neighbors.”</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>Google
<blockquote><p>Just speak a command, “OK Google. Set the temperature to 75 degrees,” and your Nest Thermostat will do as you say. And with Google Now, you can be on your way home and your thermostat will start heating or cooling before you get there.</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Nest, or Google, are not the only players in the smart-home segment. </li>
      <li>Apple had recently announced its own smarthome solution, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">HomeKit</a></li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">Quirky, too,
announced</a>
<a href="http://www.winkapp.com/">‘Wink’</a>, which is similar to ‘Works with Nest’.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>[The idea] is to set up a platform that will allow consumers to control these various devices from an app which will operate as a dashboard of sorts for everything in their connected home.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dash.by/">Dash</a> is a combination of smart driving app and hardware device that 
offers real-time feedback on your driving, trip logs, vehicle diagnostics, etc.</li>
      <li>It is not the only product out there. Others include <a href="https://www.automatic.com/">Automatic</a>, <a href="http://www.carmd.com/">CarMD</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&amp;hl=en">Torque</a> and (Pune-based) <a href="http://mycariq.com/">CarIQ</a></li>

device</a> that can be plugged into a port in the car that supports it. Most
recent models do support OBD devices.</li>
      <li>Dash has recently released upgrades including integration with <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and an API for third-party developers.</li>
      <li>With IFTTT integration, users can build simple recipes that help link
their car’s data with other tools like Google, Facebook, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.
<blockquote><p>Designed for everything from fleet tracking to personal use, the first recipes include geo-fenced alerts, SMS alerts, Check Engine Light alerts, expense tracking, trip tracking, Do Not Disturb notifications (so you’re not bothered by incoming calls when driving), Google Glass integration, smart home integration, and more.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>
        <p>Other improvements</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>In addition, Dash’s core product is seeing a number of improvements and changes too, including increased access to real-time data from more data points and gauges, a trends section that shows your Dash score, fuel efficiency/MPG and driving miles over time, automated VIN decoding (which lets the app recognize what car you’re currently plugged into), integration with automotive info site Edmunds, Android tablet support, and added support for dozens of new OBD devices and car models.</p></p><p>        <p>Although Dash is now offering users more data to look through, the company is trying to balance that with a simplified interface, so it won’t be any more of a distraction to drivers than something like a radio or nav system.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>Based on the time of day and location, for instance, the app deduces whether

      </li>
      <li>It is quite like Google Now integrated well with the UI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="nokia-x2"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/nokia-x2/">Microsoft launched its first Android smartphone, Nokia X2</a>
    <ul>
      <li>While Nokia had earlier released Nokia X, it was unclear if Microsoft 
approved of Nokia’s Android experiment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Nokia had forked Android in February to create a new smartphone platform,
Nokia X platform.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>At the time Nokia described the fork as a Lumia “feeder” — with then CEO Stephen Elop saying Nokia X devices would be a Trojan horse within Google’s ecosystem by introducing first time smartphone owners to Microsoft’s services rather than Mountain View’s.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Specs 
        <ul>
          <li>1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor</li>
          <li>1GB RAM</li>
          <li>5MP camera</li>
          <li>4.3” screen</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Processor and screen size are the primary improvements over the earlier <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/nokia-x/">Nokia X</a></li>
      <li>Like Nokia X, this offers Windows like tile-based UI along with several
Microsoft/Nokia based Android apps like
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider&amp;hl=en">Skype</a>,

    <ul>
      <li>Free OneDrive storage increased from 7GB to 15GB</li>
      <li>All versions of <a href="">Office 365</a> will now come with 1TB of space, instead
of the earlier 20GB. Prices have been slashed across plans as well.</li>
      <li>
        <p>With these changes, Microsoft seems to have ‘kicked off’ a productivity
war with Google.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“Anyone can do storage,” explains Microsoft’s head of OneDrive product management Angus Logan. “When you think of bringing in the productivity … that’s just something that Microsoft alone can deliver. No other company can deliver that.”<br/>…<br/>“When you think about productivity or authoring, Google is kind of the closest in terms of that, but I still think they’re far away,” notes Logan.<br/>…<br/>“We don’t really think of this as a storage price war,” explains Logan. “What we’re actually thinking about is a productivity war.”</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>However, even the quote retweet option requires the length of the entire
tweet to be under 140 characters, which can be quite restrictive.</li>

itself</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Y combinator startup, Cruise Automation, has developed
<a href="http://www.getcruise.com/">Cruise</a>, an auto-pilot for your car.</li>
      <li>It is not really a ‘self-driving’ car yet.  <blockquote><p>It’s<br/>designed as a computer-controlled driving system that can take over when<br/>you’re behind the wheel. Turn it on like typical cruise control and it<br/>will keep the car going, but the added smarts will steer, brake, and<br/>avoid objects.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>Not meant to replace the driver and can’t drive independently from point
A to point B. However, it can steer through stretches of road, managing
lanes and avoiding obstacles.</li>
      <li>Quite cheap compared to the ‘fully-self-driving’ options. </li>
      <li>RP-1, a $10,000 <em>kit</em>, currently compatible with two Audi models, can be
installed in the car to let it ‘cruise’ intelligently.</li>
      <li>Grander plan of the company is to collect freeway data that is shared
between vehicles
and is constantly updated between them.</li>
      <li>The technology is still in its early stages.</li>
      <li>
        <p>With Cruise, they can capture road images, GPS and inertial measurements
as well. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The goal is to create white-listed areas of freeways where the system knows its way and Cruise can be enabled.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>OPALS (Optical Payload for Lasercomm Science) provides a new method 
of data communication at extremely high speeds.</li>
      <li>
        <p>As reported by <a href="http://gizmodo.com/nasa-used-a-space-laser-to-download-video-from-orbit-at-1587523627">Gizmodo</a> earlier, on 5th June when ISS passed 
over Table Mountain Observatory in Wrightwood, California, it beamed 
a video for researchers waiting below.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>… the laser rig beamed down the “Hello, World” video shown below in a mere 3.5 seconds, a feat that would have taken more than 10 minutes using traditional radio frequencies currently used for data transmission to outer space.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>For hosting, however, they have partnered with Squarespace, Wix, Weebly, and Shopify</li>
      <li>
        <p>The benefits?</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>First, it’s promising not to charge users anything extra to conceal personal information (e.g. name and address) that must be provided when registering a URL. Google Domains users can create up to 100 email aliases using their domain, and Mountain View also says it’s making domain forwarding super easy in case there’s already a Tumblr or existing site you’d like your new URL to point to. And you shouldn’t run into any problems or downtime (at least on Google’s end). Google Domains use the same DNS servers as Google’s other websites, ensuring “your domain will connect quickly and reliably to your website.”</p></p><p>        <p>Lastly, there’s the benefit of real customer support. Google says phone and email support will be available Monday through Friday from 9AM to 9PM EST</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Baarzo’s technology description:
<blockquote><p>Unlike Google or YouTube searches, which only evaluate the text around the video, the Baarzo search technology actually analyzes the video content, recognizing hundreds of thousands of objects and millions of faces, and locates the precise moment in the video when the search objects interact in the way you had specified.</p></blockquote></li>

If you use Lotus, you employ less DSLs and more objects, zero monkey-patching, separation of concerns between MVC layers. Each library is designed to be small (under 500LOCs), fast and testable.<br/>…<br/>We have infinite combinations. Small components have enormous advantadges in terms of reusability.</p></p><p>        <p>The power of these frameworks is combined together in Lotus applications.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>At Georgia Institute of Technology, a wireless glove, Mobile Music Touch (MMT),
has been developed that enables users to learn to play piano melodies while 
performing everyday tasks. </li>
      <li>The process is called ‘Passive Haptic Learning’.
<blockquote><p>Vibration motors are embedded in the glove at the base of each finger and the thumb.  The song being learned can be loaded onto a user’s mobile phone and is played as they go about their business.  As each note is played, the glove taps the finger corresponding to the appropriate key on a piano keyboard.  The result: in as little as 30 minutes, the user learns the “muscle memory” of the first phrases of the song, even if their attention has been devoted to another task.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>
        <p>Even when distracted while the MMT tapped their fingers by tasks, like reading
emails, taking a graduate entrance exam and watching a movie, the subjects
were able to learn to play the songs.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Surprisingly, only the vibration was needed for the glove to be effective– on average, participants who only “felt” the music performed as well as those who heard the audio concurrently.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Experiments suggest that it can also use in rehabilitation to help those
with paralysis because of spinal injuries.</li>

in their houses, so that they can check in on their home, irrespective 
of where they are in the world.</li>
      <li>Dropcam can be used to keep tabs on doors, windows or valuables at home. 
Even useful as a child monitoring tool.</li>
      <li>Nest, the company that creates intelligent thermostats, was acquired 
by Google recently. </li>
      <li>Like Nest’s acquisition by Google, this raises some privacy concerns. </li>
      <li>Probably to stave off thoughts like, “Now Google gets a video feed in 
my house!”, Nest explains in it’s blogpost that
<blockquote><p>Once the deal closes, we’ll incorporate Dropcam into how we do business at Nest. That includes how we handle everything from customer support to customer privacy. Like Nest customer data, Dropcam will come under Nest’s privacy policy, which explains that data won’t be shared with anyone (including Google) without a customer’s permission. Nest has a paid-for business model and ads are not part of our strategy. In acquiring Dropcam, we’ll apply that same policy to Dropcam too.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>The numbers are not stated on their blogpost, but sources like <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/20/google-and-nest-acquire-dropcam-for-555-million/">techrunch</a>

    <ul>
      <li>A British Columbia court ordered Google (temporary injunction) to block
certain websites from ‘worldwide search engine’</li>
      <li>This raises the question of how much control can a country’s court exert 
on the Internet.</li>
      <li>The case in discussion involves a company whose trade secrets were stollen 
to create a competing product, which is being sold through a network 
of websites despite several court orders.</li>
      <li>While current procedures allow Google to block search results within 
Canada, since most sales occur outside Canada, they have been asked to 
block the site across the entire system. </li>
      <li><blockquote><p>But University of Ottawa law professor Michael Geist slammed the recent Google decision in a blog post on Tuesday, warning that it could lead to other countries demanding Google censor content worldwide, putting free speech at risk. “While the court does not grapple with this possibility, what happens if a Russian court orders Google to remove gay and lesbian sites from its database? Or if Iran orders it remove Israeli sites from the database?”</p></blockquote></li>

    <id>http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/06/17/tech-news-about-qeexos-fingersense-wristify-loon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/qeexo">Qeexo, a startup, is trying to redefine how we use touchscreens</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the unveiling of iPhone, 7 years ago, not much has changed in how 
we interact with touchscreens.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Qeexo has developed a touchscreen technology capable of detecting difference
between a fingertip, a knuckle, fingernail and a stylus.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Today, FingerSense uses the standard accelerometer in a mobile device to pick up on the vibration patterns different parts of the hand produce when they come in contact with a touchscreen. The FingerSense machine-learning engine understands what part of the finger is touching the screen and triggers a correlated action. For instance, tapping a block of text with your knuckle could trigger the copy and paste menu to appear. To select text, you’d simply drag your knuckle down the text,much like you would a desktop mouse.</p></blockquote>
<!--more--></p>
      </li>
      <li>However, to be able to make an impact, the startup would need to be able 
 to convince the giants like Apple and Samsung to not only change the way
 touchscreen works, but also agree upon standards to make sure the same 
 gesture has similar behavior across devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/">Wristify, a wristband that could make air conditioning obsolete</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Being prototyped at MIT, <a href="http://wristifyme.com/">Writify</a>, is trying to provide 
 temperature control (the function of a thermostat) by deceiving our senses.</li>
      <li>It tries to exploit the idea that cooling or heating only a part of the
 body makes us think differently about how cold or hot we are. </li>
      <li>Not only can it make AC’s obsolete, but also allow personalized, dynamic
 climate control. So, two people in the same room can enjoy a personalized
 climate. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-balloons-year-later">Google’s balloon project, a year later</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A year ago, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html">announced the Loon project</a>. 
Its aims and ideas can be summarized by 
<blockquote><p>We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides Internet access to the earth below.<br /></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Over the year, they have been able to demonstrate how the plan can succeed.</li>
      <li>While initially, the balloons only lasted only a few days, Google was able
to identify the causes of failure by extensive analysis. </li>
      <li>Small, undetectable leaks in the polymer skins that must withstand huge
atmospheric pressure were identified as the primary cause of failure.</li>
      <li>
        <p>“The Loon crew not only strengthened the fragile seams where leaks often
occurred but took fanatic care in handling the envelopes.”
<blockquote><p></p></p><p>        <p>Google also improved Loon flight times by dramatically upgrading the altitude control system, increasing the vertical range of the balloons so they can catch more favorable winds. (Its balloons “steer” their way around the world by placing themselves in wind currents headed in the right direction.) As a result, it’s not unusual for Google to keep balloons flying for 75 days. One craft, dubbed Ibis 152 (Google uses bird species to nickname its balloons), has been aloft over 100 daysand is still flying. An earlier balloon, Ibis 162, circled the globe three times before descending. (It completed one circumnavigation in 22 days, a world record.) </p></p><p>        <p></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the balloons had to stay in flight for long, Google couldn’t just rely
 on the data from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which
 supplied forecast for only 16 days. Google uses a giant database of weather 
 data to predict weather and wind conditions to be able to plot the optimal
 path (maximize battery life and avoid bad weather).</p>
      </li>
      <li>Loon can now also send data using LTE spectrum.
        <ul>
          <li>This boost the capacity of connections.</li>
          <li>Provides a reason for telecommunication companies to partner with them
to help provide signal in dead spots even in urban areas.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Google had recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/google-acquires-titan-aerospace-the-drone-company-pursued-by-facebook/">acquired Titan Aerospace</a>,
which makes high-altitude, solar powered drones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>By the next year, they expect to be able to provide service in certain
areas/countries.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/microsoft_blog/archive/2014/06/16/microsoft-azure-machine-learning-combines-power-of-comprehensive-machine-learning-with-benefits-of-cloud.aspx">Microsoft Azure ML as a service</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Microsoft is using its experience in Machine Learning and its own cloud platform, 
Azure, to provide a platform for building ‘predictive analytics solutions’</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, a fully-managed cloud service for building predictive analytics solutions, helps overcome the challenges most businesses have in deploying and using machine learning. How? By delivering a comprehensive machine learning service that has all the benefits of the cloud. In mere hours, with Azure ML, customers and partners can build data-driven applications to predict, forecast and change future outcomes – a process that previously took weeks and months.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>From the description, it appears that the streaming experience was as if the file was present locally.</li>
