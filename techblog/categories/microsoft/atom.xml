    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://nest.com/works-with-nest">Works with Nest</a> is a program where
Nest (as an independent entity under Google) is allowing developers to
use Nest’s APIs to convey information to Nest and help create a ‘smart
home’ or ‘internet of things’. This video gives a good insight into their
vision and the direction they are headed.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bPdltu-93pM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>Several big names have associated with the program already
        <ul>
          <li>Mercedes-Benz
<blockquote><p>Your car can tell Nest when you’ll be home so your thermostat can start heating or cooling at exactly the right time. It keeps you from wasting energy, and means you’re comfortable as soon as you walk in the door.</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>
            <p>Whirlpool</p>

            <p><blockquote><p>If your Nest Thermostat notices you’re away, it can have Whirlpool switch to a refresh mode when your cycle ends, so your clothes stay fresh and wrinkle-free<br/>…<br/>If you’re signed up for Rush Hour Rewards with a participating energy provider, Nest can let Whirlpool know when an energy rush hour is about to happen, and your washer or dryer will delay the start of the cycle until the rush hour is over</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Charmberlain (garage automation)
<blockquote><p>Open the garage when you arrive, and Chamberlain can tell Nest you’re home. Close it on your way out, and your thermostat can go into Away mode so you don’t waste energy heating or cooling an empty home.</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>IFTTT
<blockquote><p>Create your own connections with one simple statement – “if this then that.” For example, “If my Nest Protect detects smoke, then send a text message to my neighbors.”</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>Google
<blockquote><p>Just speak a command, “OK Google. Set the temperature to 75 degrees,” and your Nest Thermostat will do as you say. And with Google Now, you can be on your way home and your thermostat will start heating or cooling before you get there.</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Nest, or Google, are not the only players in the smart-home segment. </li>
      <li>Apple had recently announced its own smarthome solution, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">HomeKit</a></li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">Quirky, too,
announced</a>
<a href="http://www.winkapp.com/">‘Wink’</a>, which is similar to ‘Works with Nest’.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>[The idea] is to set up a platform that will allow consumers to control these various devices from an app which will operate as a dashboard of sorts for everything in their connected home.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="dash"></a> <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/with-a-series-of-upgrades-dash-becomes-a-viable-competitor-among-smart-driving-apps/">Dash : A rising star among the smart driving apps</a>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dash.by/">Dash</a> is a combination of smart driving app and hardware device that 
offers real-time feedback on your driving, trip logs, vehicle diagnostics, etc.</li>
      <li>It is not the only product out there. Others include <a href="https://www.automatic.com/">Automatic</a>, <a href="http://www.carmd.com/">CarMD</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&amp;hl=en">Torque</a> and (Pune-based) <a href="http://mycariq.com/">CarIQ</a></li>
      <li>These work by interacting with a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00H9S71LW/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B00H9S71LW&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=daslab-20">Bluetooth-enabled OBD(On-board
Diagnostics)
device</a> that can be plugged into a port in the car that supports it. Most
recent models do support OBD devices.</li>
      <li>Dash has recently released upgrades including integration with <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and an API for third-party developers.</li>
      <li>With IFTTT integration, users can build simple recipes that help link
their car’s data with other tools like Google, Facebook, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.
<blockquote><p>Designed for everything from fleet tracking to personal use, the first recipes include geo-fenced alerts, SMS alerts, Check Engine Light alerts, expense tracking, trip tracking, Do Not Disturb notifications (so you’re not bothered by incoming calls when driving), Google Glass integration, smart home integration, and more.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>
        <p>Other improvements</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>In addition, Dash’s core product is seeing a number of improvements and changes too, including increased access to real-time data from more data points and gauges, a trends section that shows your Dash score, fuel efficiency/MPG and driving miles over time, automated VIN decoding (which lets the app recognize what car you’re currently plugged into), integration with automotive info site Edmunds, Android tablet support, and added support for dozens of new OBD devices and car models.</p></p><p>        <p>Although Dash is now offering users more data to look through, the company is trying to balance that with a simplified interface, so it won’t be any more of a distraction to drivers than something like a radio or nav system.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
    </ul>

  <li><a name="aviate"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/23/yahoo-releases-aviate-homescreen-for-android-to-organize-your-life/">Yahoo Releases Aviate Homescreen For Android To Organize Your Life</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Aviate was acquired by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/yahoo-announces-that-it-has-acquired-intelligent-homescreen-startup-aviate/">Yahoo in January</a></li>
      <li>It was an app that provided contextually relevant information on Android
homescreens.</li>
      <li>Now, Yahoo Aviate replaces the launcher in your phone to provide a smarter,
context aware interface.</li>
      <li>Based on the time of day and location, for instance, the app deduces whether
you need applications related to work or entertainment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The most popular contacts are also, automatically, pulled to the favorites
list.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/gj-cYb9eiRY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>

        <p><blockquote><p>Yahoo Aviate simplifies everything about your phone. It starts with a clean, new layout and apps automatically organized for you. But it’s not just about making your phone simpler – Aviate also makes your phone smarter by offering intelligent information throughout your day. Whether you’re on the go, at work, at a restaurant or just relaxing at home, Aviate automatically shows you apps and information that are useful to you based on what you’re up to</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>It is quite like Google Now integrated well with the UI.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="nokia-x2"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/24/nokia-x2/">Microsoft launched its first Android smartphone, Nokia X2</a>
    <ul>
      <li>While Nokia had earlier released Nokia X, it was unclear if Microsoft 
approved of Nokia’s Android experiment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Nokia had forked Android in February to create a new smartphone platform,
Nokia X platform.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>At the time Nokia described the fork as a Lumia “feeder” — with then CEO Stephen Elop saying Nokia X devices would be a Trojan horse within Google’s ecosystem by introducing first time smartphone owners to Microsoft’s services rather than Mountain View’s.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Specs 
        <ul>
          <li>1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor</li>
          <li>1GB RAM</li>
          <li>5MP camera</li>
          <li>4.3” screen</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Processor and screen size are the primary improvements over the earlier <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/nokia-x/">Nokia X</a></li>
      <li>Like Nokia X, this offers Windows like tile-based UI along with several
Microsoft/Nokia based Android apps like
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.skype.raider&amp;hl=en">Skype</a>,
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.microsoft.skydrive&amp;hl=en">OneDrive</a>,
<a href="http://here.com/">Here Maps</a> pre-installed.</li>
      <li>Dual SIM support, something popular in emerging markets.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="onedrive"></a><a href="http://www.theverge.com/2014/6/23/5833808/onedrive-free-storage-increase-pricing-productivity-war">Microsoft doubles free OneDrive Storage</a>
    <ul>
      <li>Free OneDrive storage increased from 7GB to 15GB</li>
      <li>All versions of <a href="">Office 365</a> will now come with 1TB of space, instead
of the earlier 20GB. Prices have been slashed across plans as well.</li>
      <li>
        <p>With these changes, Microsoft seems to have ‘kicked off’ a productivity
war with Google.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“Anyone can do storage,” explains Microsoft’s head of OneDrive product management Angus Logan. “When you think of bringing in the productivity … that’s just something that Microsoft alone can deliver. No other company can deliver that.”<br/>…<br/>“When you think about productivity or authoring, Google is kind of the closest in terms of that, but I still think they’re far away,” notes Logan.<br/>…<br/>“We don’t really think of this as a storage price war,” explains Logan. “What we’re actually thinking about is a productivity war.”</p></blockquote></p>

    <id>http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/06/17/tech-news-about-qeexos-fingersense-wristify-loon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<ol>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/qeexo">Qeexo, a startup, is trying to redefine how we use touchscreens</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the unveiling of iPhone, 7 years ago, not much has changed in how 
we interact with touchscreens.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Qeexo has developed a touchscreen technology capable of detecting difference
between a fingertip, a knuckle, fingernail and a stylus.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Today, FingerSense uses the standard accelerometer in a mobile device to pick up on the vibration patterns different parts of the hand produce when they come in contact with a touchscreen. The FingerSense machine-learning engine understands what part of the finger is touching the screen and triggers a correlated action. For instance, tapping a block of text with your knuckle could trigger the copy and paste menu to appear. To select text, you’d simply drag your knuckle down the text,much like you would a desktop mouse.</p></blockquote>
<!--more--></p>
      </li>
      <li>However, to be able to make an impact, the startup would need to be able 
 to convince the giants like Apple and Samsung to not only change the way
 touchscreen works, but also agree upon standards to make sure the same 
 gesture has similar behavior across devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/">Wristify, a wristband that could make air conditioning obsolete</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Being prototyped at MIT, <a href="http://wristifyme.com/">Writify</a>, is trying to provide 
 temperature control (the function of a thermostat) by deceiving our senses.</li>
      <li>It tries to exploit the idea that cooling or heating only a part of the
 body makes us think differently about how cold or hot we are. </li>
      <li>Not only can it make AC’s obsolete, but also allow personalized, dynamic
 climate control. So, two people in the same room can enjoy a personalized
 climate. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-balloons-year-later">Google’s balloon project, a year later</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A year ago, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html">announced the Loon project</a>. 
Its aims and ideas can be summarized by 
<blockquote><p>We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides Internet access to the earth below.<br /></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Over the year, they have been able to demonstrate how the plan can succeed.</li>
      <li>While initially, the balloons only lasted only a few days, Google was able
to identify the causes of failure by extensive analysis. </li>
      <li>Small, undetectable leaks in the polymer skins that must withstand huge
atmospheric pressure were identified as the primary cause of failure.</li>
      <li>
        <p>“The Loon crew not only strengthened the fragile seams where leaks often
occurred but took fanatic care in handling the envelopes.”
<blockquote><p></p></p><p>        <p>Google also improved Loon flight times by dramatically upgrading the altitude control system, increasing the vertical range of the balloons so they can catch more favorable winds. (Its balloons “steer” their way around the world by placing themselves in wind currents headed in the right direction.) As a result, it’s not unusual for Google to keep balloons flying for 75 days. One craft, dubbed Ibis 152 (Google uses bird species to nickname its balloons), has been aloft over 100 daysand is still flying. An earlier balloon, Ibis 162, circled the globe three times before descending. (It completed one circumnavigation in 22 days, a world record.) </p></p><p>        <p></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the balloons had to stay in flight for long, Google couldn’t just rely
 on the data from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which
 supplied forecast for only 16 days. Google uses a giant database of weather 
 data to predict weather and wind conditions to be able to plot the optimal
 path (maximize battery life and avoid bad weather).</p>
      </li>
      <li>Loon can now also send data using LTE spectrum.
        <ul>
          <li>This boost the capacity of connections.</li>
          <li>Provides a reason for telecommunication companies to partner with them
to help provide signal in dead spots even in urban areas.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Google had recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/google-acquires-titan-aerospace-the-drone-company-pursued-by-facebook/">acquired Titan Aerospace</a>,
which makes high-altitude, solar powered drones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>By the next year, they expect to be able to provide service in certain
areas/countries.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Microsoft is using its experience in Machine Learning and its own cloud platform, 
Azure, to provide a platform for building ‘predictive analytics solutions’</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, a fully-managed cloud service for building predictive analytics solutions, helps overcome the challenges most businesses have in deploying and using machine learning. How? By delivering a comprehensive machine learning service that has all the benefits of the cloud. In mere hours, with Azure ML, customers and partners can build data-driven applications to predict, forecast and change future outcomes – a process that previously took weeks and months.</p></blockquote></p>
