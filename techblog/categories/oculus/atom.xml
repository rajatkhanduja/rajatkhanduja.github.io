    <p><blockquote><p>If this campaign succeeds, the money will let me dedicate the time needed to bring this next, drastically improved, version of Xiki to the world. Xiki plugins for Sublime and Vim will be created. The installer and initial user experience will be greatly improved (largely by adding contextual menus everywhere). The integration with the shell will be improved. To enable supporting new Xiki plugins, the core of Xiki will be refactored. It will do the heavy lifting so the plugins will no longer have to.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/">RakNet</a> is a cross-platform C++ network engine for game development. 
 <blockquote><p>The tech is tuned for cross-platform, high-performance applications that operate across a wide variety of network types. Key features include object replication, remote procedure calls, patching, secure connections, voice chat, and real-time SQL logging. The technology has been licensed by thousands of indie developers, as well as companies like Unity, Havok, Mojang, Maxis and Sony Online Entertainment.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After using it internally for quite some time, Oculus has now <a href="https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet">open sourced RakNet</a> under BSD License.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>They announced their own developer conference <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/connect/">Oculus Connect</a> “that brings together engineers,
designers, and creatives from around the world to share and collaborate in the interest of creating the best virtual reality experiences
possible.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Oculus Connect is scheduled for September 19-20 and attendee applications will open on July 10th.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It would be a great conference for all those interested in VR, especially in Oculus’s products.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Attendees will be the first to learn about upcoming Oculus technology, with sessions and workshops led by Oculus engineers and industry pioneers. Developers at the event will also have opportunities to receive design and engineering feedback directly from the Oculus team in hands-on labs.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The core idea of <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/">Inbox</a> is to help developers exploit email as a platform without the hassles of archaic 
protocols like IMAP and SMTP. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“I actually wrote my thesis at MIT on email tools, and discovered how difficult it was to add features to email apps,” explains Grinich [co-founded] of how Inbox came to be. “One big issue was the underlying plumbing – IMAP, MIME, character encodings, etc. – which is what Inbox fixes for developers.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inbox provide <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs">REST APIs</a> to retrieve, modify and send emails. It also provides APIs for complex tasks like 
custom filtering, accessing attachments, creating drafts, etc.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs/javascript">Javascript</a> and <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs/ios">iOS</a> SDKs are already available.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Founded by MIT Alums.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The company was co-founded by MIT alums, Michael Grinich, previously an engineer at Dropbox and designer Nest, and Christine Spang, an early Linux kernel engineer at Ksplice (acquired by Oracle.) The core team at Inbox also includes several other MIT alums, plus those with experience from Google and Firebase, as well as two graduates from the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT CSAIL, which spun out Meraki (acquired by Cisco).</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The company would also provide fundamental infrastructure as an open source package.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Carolina Healthcare Systems is buying credit-card data of its customers to be able to better predict the chances of them getting ill 
and provide them with relevant care and advice before that happens.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By tracking expenses, they hope to be able to get insights into their habits. This can provide much more information than can be 
attained by the little time the doctor gets to assess a patient.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>For a patient with asthma, the hospital would be able to assess how likely he is to arrive at the emergency room by looking at whether he’s refilled his asthma medication at the pharmacy, has been buying cigarettes at the grocery store, and lives in an area with a high pollen count, Dulin says. The system may also look at the probability of someone having a heart attack by considering factors such as the type of foods she buys and if she has a gym membership. “The idea is to use Big Data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels,” he says.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While the supporters argue that such data is already used to targetted advertising and this is a much better use of the same information,
there are a lot of privacy concerns around the use of data for health tracking and unsolicited help.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“It is one thing to have a number I can call if I have a problem or question; it is another thing to get unsolicited phone calls. I don’t like that,” says Jorjanne Murry, an accountant in Charlotte who has Type 1 diabetes and says she usually ignores calls from her health insurer trying to discuss her daily habits. “I think it is intrusive.”</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The study</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard and the movement of the leaf in 
response to the chewing was measured and recorded, using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations were played back to a set of plants, while only silence was played back on the other.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were later fed on these plants.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Findings</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>“What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said. “This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How can it be used?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><blockquote><p>“Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,” Appel said. “This research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.”</p></blockquote></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a name="securedrop"></a><a href="https://ssl.washingtonpost.com/securedrop">SecureDrop</a>      </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>SecureDrop, by Washington Post, is a discreet way to share messages and materials with their journalists.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While it doesn’t claim to be perfect, it claims to offer greater security and anonymity than conventional e-mail and Web forms
by minimizing digital trails left by the communication between the provider and Washington Post.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It relies on Tor and requires the user to access <strong>http://vbmwh445kf3fs2v4.onion</strong>, preferably using a Tor browser. From the URL, 
the user would be able to upload documents to a ‘secure dropbox’ which is  periodically checked.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The URL also provides a codename to log in and check for replies.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Keep the codename you are provided safe and secure. We will not know your codename, and you should never share it with anyone. If you forget your codename, we will have no other way to contact you.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://nest.com/works-with-nest">Works with Nest</a> is a program where
Nest (as an independent entity under Google) is allowing developers to
use Nest’s APIs to convey information to Nest and help create a ‘smart
home’ or ‘internet of things’. This video gives a good insight into their
vision and the direction they are headed.</p>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/bPdltu-93pM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>Several big names have associated with the program already
        <ul>
          <li>Mercedes-Benz
<blockquote><p>Your car can tell Nest when you’ll be home so your thermostat can start heating or cooling at exactly the right time. It keeps you from wasting energy, and means you’re comfortable as soon as you walk in the door.</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>
            <p>Whirlpool</p>

            <p><blockquote><p>If your Nest Thermostat notices you’re away, it can have Whirlpool switch to a refresh mode when your cycle ends, so your clothes stay fresh and wrinkle-free<br/>…<br/>If you’re signed up for Rush Hour Rewards with a participating energy provider, Nest can let Whirlpool know when an energy rush hour is about to happen, and your washer or dryer will delay the start of the cycle until the rush hour is over</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Charmberlain (garage automation)
<blockquote><p>Open the garage when you arrive, and Chamberlain can tell Nest you’re home. Close it on your way out, and your thermostat can go into Away mode so you don’t waste energy heating or cooling an empty home.</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>IFTTT
<blockquote><p>Create your own connections with one simple statement – “if this then that.” For example, “If my Nest Protect detects smoke, then send a text message to my neighbors.”</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>Google
<blockquote><p>Just speak a command, “OK Google. Set the temperature to 75 degrees,” and your Nest Thermostat will do as you say. And with Google Now, you can be on your way home and your thermostat will start heating or cooling before you get there.</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Nest, or Google, are not the only players in the smart-home segment. </li>
      <li>Apple had recently announced its own smarthome solution, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">HomeKit</a></li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/02/apple-wwdc-smart-home/">Quirky, too,
announced</a>
<a href="http://www.winkapp.com/">‘Wink’</a>, which is similar to ‘Works with Nest’.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>[The idea] is to set up a platform that will allow consumers to control these various devices from an app which will operate as a dashboard of sorts for everything in their connected home.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://dash.by/">Dash</a> is a combination of smart driving app and hardware device that 
offers real-time feedback on your driving, trip logs, vehicle diagnostics, etc.</li>
      <li>It is not the only product out there. Others include <a href="https://www.automatic.com/">Automatic</a>, <a href="http://www.carmd.com/">CarMD</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.prowl.torque&amp;hl=en">Torque</a> and (Pune-based) <a href="http://mycariq.com/">CarIQ</a></li>

device</a> that can be plugged into a port in the car that supports it. Most
recent models do support OBD devices.</li>
      <li>Dash has recently released upgrades including integration with <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and an API for third-party developers.</li>
      <li>With IFTTT integration, users can build simple recipes that help link
their car’s data with other tools like Google, Facebook, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.
<blockquote><p>Designed for everything from fleet tracking to personal use, the first recipes include geo-fenced alerts, SMS alerts, Check Engine Light alerts, expense tracking, trip tracking, Do Not Disturb notifications (so you’re not bothered by incoming calls when driving), Google Glass integration, smart home integration, and more.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>
        <p>Other improvements</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>In addition, Dash’s core product is seeing a number of improvements and changes too, including increased access to real-time data from more data points and gauges, a trends section that shows your Dash score, fuel efficiency/MPG and driving miles over time, automated VIN decoding (which lets the app recognize what car you’re currently plugged into), integration with automotive info site Edmunds, Android tablet support, and added support for dozens of new OBD devices and car models.</p></p><p>        <p>Although Dash is now offering users more data to look through, the company is trying to balance that with a simplified interface, so it won’t be any more of a distraction to drivers than something like a radio or nav system.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>Aviate was acquired by <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/01/07/yahoo-announces-that-it-has-acquired-intelligent-homescreen-startup-aviate/">Yahoo in January</a></li>
      <li>It was an app that provided contextually relevant information on Android
homescreens.</li>
      <li>Now, Yahoo Aviate replaces the launcher in your phone to provide a smarter,
context aware interface.</li>
      <li>Based on the time of day and location, for instance, the app deduces whether
you need applications related to work or entertainment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The most popular contacts are also, automatically, pulled to the favorites
list.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Yahoo Aviate simplifies everything about your phone. It starts with a clean, new layout and apps automatically organized for you. But it’s not just about making your phone simpler – Aviate also makes your phone smarter by offering intelligent information throughout your day. Whether you’re on the go, at work, at a restaurant or just relaxing at home, Aviate automatically shows you apps and information that are useful to you based on what you’re up to</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>While Nokia had earlier released Nokia X, it was unclear if Microsoft 
approved of Nokia’s Android experiment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Nokia had forked Android in February to create a new smartphone platform,
Nokia X platform.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>At the time Nokia described the fork as a Lumia “feeder” — with then CEO Stephen Elop saying Nokia X devices would be a Trojan horse within Google’s ecosystem by introducing first time smartphone owners to Microsoft’s services rather than Mountain View’s.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Free OneDrive storage increased from 7GB to 15GB</li>
      <li>All versions of <a href="">Office 365</a> will now come with 1TB of space, instead
of the earlier 20GB. Prices have been slashed across plans as well.</li>
      <li>
        <p>With these changes, Microsoft seems to have ‘kicked off’ a productivity
war with Google.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“Anyone can do storage,” explains Microsoft’s head of OneDrive product management Angus Logan. “When you think of bringing in the productivity … that’s just something that Microsoft alone can deliver. No other company can deliver that.”<br/>…<br/>“When you think about productivity or authoring, Google is kind of the closest in terms of that, but I still think they’re far away,” notes Logan.<br/>…<br/>“We don’t really think of this as a storage price war,” explains Logan. “What we’re actually thinking about is a productivity war.”</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>Twitter currently allows the users to either direclty retweet a tweet
or ‘quote’ a tweet, allowing someone to tag someone or add some more text.</li>
      <li>However, even the quote retweet option requires the length of the entire
tweet to be under 140 characters, which can be quite restrictive.</li>

        <p>Twitter is experimenting a new feature ‘Retweet with comments’ with a 
segment of its users.</p>
