  <li><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/facebook-slingshot/">Facebook’s Slingshot challenges SnapChat with ‘Reply to Unlock’</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook’s new app <a href="http://www.sling.me/">Slingshot</a> is being seen as a 
competitor to SnapChat. </li>
      <li>It lets you share photos and 15-second videos with users on Slingshot.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The content is meant to be ephemeral, much like SnapChat. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>As for what happens to your content, once everyone you’ve slinged something to views it, Facebook says it will delete the photo or video from its servers. There is a seven-day delay in case it has to investigate abuse reports, but the team says the content is gone after that. Whether users trust Facebook to keep its word is up to them. Past privacy missteps might scare people, but Facebook is under close scrutiny from the FTC to abide by the privacy policies it puts forward.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>An important catch in the app is that you can’t view the content shared 
by the user until you reply to it. (‘Reply to Unlock’)</li>
      <li>This aims to increase reciprocation and make everyone a content generator.</li>
      <li>Slingshot was born out of a hackathon. The motivation can be summarized by 
<blockquote><p>“My brothers are really not technical in any way”, Slingshot inventor and four-year Facebook Product Designer Joey Flynn tells me. “I’d take a photo, upload it in iMessage, and send it to them. And I would just see “Seen”, or in a month I’d see them and they‘d say ‘that was a cool photo’. But hey, I want to see what you’re up to! There was this missing reciprocation” he explains. That was the spark for Slingshot.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>This app was <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/09/slingshot-app/">earlier released on app stored by mistake</a></li>
      <li>Facebook had tried to buy off SnapChat, but <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/us-facebook-snapchat-idUSBRE9AC11E20131113">SnapChat had rejected the $3 billion buyout offer</a></li>

    <p><strong><a href="http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/">Browser based javascript cryptography considered harmful</a></strong></p>

    <p>Some of the things pointed out in the article. <em>[Not being an expert in cryptography, I would recommend readers to read
   the original article to avoid any miscommunication]</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code could be injected when in transit. Can use SSL/TLS to avoid that, but 
then, in most cases, you could simply avoid cryptography at 
user end.</li>
      <li>There’s no certainty of information being removed from memory.</li>
      <li>It is not possible to verify the code/environment to be exactly as it is 
required to be. </li>
      <li>Javascript lacks a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). </li>
      <li><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/">Stanford Javascript Crypto library (SJCL)</a>
developed at Stanford is a great work, but still insecure.
<blockquote><p>The authors of SJCL themselves say, “Unfortunately, this is not as great as in desktop applications because it is not feasible to completely protect against code injection, malicious servers and side-channel attacks.” That last example is a killer: what they’re really saying is, “we don’t know enough about Javascript runtimes to know whether we can securely host cryptography on them”. Again, that’s painful-but-tolerable in a server-side application, where you can always call out to native code as a workaround. It’s death to a browser.</p></blockquote></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/press-releases/uk-intelligence-forced-to-reveal-secret-policy-for-mass-surveillance-of-residents">UK intelligence forced to reveal secret policy for mass surveillance of
residents’ Facebook and Google
use</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret policy define UK residents’ communication on Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.
as ‘external communication’ because they use platforms based in the US, even
if the communication is between two people in the UK.</li>
      <li>This grants the secret services to indiscriminately intercept communication
on these platforms.</li>
      <li>For an ‘internal communication’, a warrant would be required, however that 
is not the case with ‘external communication’.
<blockquote><p>The Government believes that, even when privacy violations happen, it is not an “active intrusion” because the analyst reading or listening to an individual’s communication will inevitably forget about it anyway.</p></blockquote></li>
    </ul>
  </li>

    <p><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/dropbox-has-quietly-acquired-parastructure-a-big-data-startup-in-stealth/">Dropbox acquired Parastructure, a Big Data Startup</a></strong>
 -
 <blockquote><p>So what exactly is Parastructure? According to the company’s LinkedIn profile, and its (now-offline) home page, it builds “beautiful data analysis software powered by cutting-edge open source infrastructure.” Parastructure’s GitHub pages give some clues as to what that data-analysis software was tackling, with areas covering Spark for cluster computing; Phoenix, a SQL skin over HBase; CrunchBase; and so on</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The acquisition was done quite stealthily.</li>
      <li>Probably, Dropbox requires the software and the team to analyze its data</li>
      <li>Parastructure was an enterprise oriented startup and its acquisition indicates 
Dropbox’s intention on strengthening their image as an enterprise product.</li>
      <li>Dropbox’s increased effort in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business">Dropbox for
Business</a> brings it in direct
competition with Box, which is currently leading as an enterprise
solution.</li>
      <li>Both the companies are quite aggressively acquiring companies. </li>
      <li>In fact, Parastructure was acquired on the same day as 
<a href="/techblog/2014/06/17/tech-news-about-qeexos-fingersense-wristify-loon/">Box acquired Streem</a></li>

  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/qeexo">Qeexo, a startup, is trying to redefine how we use touchscreens</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the unveiling of iPhone, 7 years ago, not much has changed in how 
we interact with touchscreens.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Qeexo has developed a touchscreen technology capable of detecting difference
between a fingertip, a knuckle, fingernail and a stylus.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Today, FingerSense uses the standard accelerometer in a mobile device to pick up on the vibration patterns different parts of the hand produce when they come in contact with a touchscreen. The FingerSense machine-learning engine understands what part of the finger is touching the screen and triggers a correlated action. For instance, tapping a block of text with your knuckle could trigger the copy and paste menu to appear. To select text, you’d simply drag your knuckle down the text,much like you would a desktop mouse.</p></blockquote>
<!--more--></p>
      </li>
      <li>However, to be able to make an impact, the startup would need to be able 
 to convince the giants like Apple and Samsung to not only change the way
 touchscreen works, but also agree upon standards to make sure the same 
 gesture has similar behavior across devices.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2013/10/an-ingenious-wristband-that-keeps-your-body-at-the-perfect-temperature-no-ac-required/">Wristify, a wristband that could make air conditioning obsolete</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Being prototyped at MIT, <a href="http://wristifyme.com/">Writify</a>, is trying to provide 
 temperature control (the function of a thermostat) by deceiving our senses.</li>
      <li>It tries to exploit the idea that cooling or heating only a part of the
 body makes us think differently about how cold or hot we are. </li>
      <li>Not only can it make AC’s obsolete, but also allow personalized, dynamic
 climate control. So, two people in the same room can enjoy a personalized
 climate. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/06/google-balloons-year-later">Google’s balloon project, a year later</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A year ago, Google <a href="http://googleblog.blogspot.in/2013/06/introducing-project-loon.html">announced the Loon project</a>. 
Its aims and ideas can be summarized by 
<blockquote><p>We believe that it might actually be possible to build a ring of balloons, flying around the globe on the stratospheric winds, that provides Internet access to the earth below.<br /></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Over the year, they have been able to demonstrate how the plan can succeed.</li>
      <li>While initially, the balloons only lasted only a few days, Google was able
to identify the causes of failure by extensive analysis. </li>
      <li>Small, undetectable leaks in the polymer skins that must withstand huge
atmospheric pressure were identified as the primary cause of failure.</li>
      <li>
        <p>“The Loon crew not only strengthened the fragile seams where leaks often
occurred but took fanatic care in handling the envelopes.”
<blockquote><p></p></p><p>        <p>Google also improved Loon flight times by dramatically upgrading the altitude control system, increasing the vertical range of the balloons so they can catch more favorable winds. (Its balloons “steer” their way around the world by placing themselves in wind currents headed in the right direction.) As a result, it’s not unusual for Google to keep balloons flying for 75 days. One craft, dubbed Ibis 152 (Google uses bird species to nickname its balloons), has been aloft over 100 daysand is still flying. An earlier balloon, Ibis 162, circled the globe three times before descending. (It completed one circumnavigation in 22 days, a world record.) </p></p><p>        <p></p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Since the balloons had to stay in flight for long, Google couldn’t just rely
 on the data from National Oceanic Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), which
 supplied forecast for only 16 days. Google uses a giant database of weather 
 data to predict weather and wind conditions to be able to plot the optimal
 path (maximize battery life and avoid bad weather).</p>
      </li>
      <li>Loon can now also send data using LTE spectrum.
        <ul>
          <li>This boost the capacity of connections.</li>
          <li>Provides a reason for telecommunication companies to partner with them
to help provide signal in dead spots even in urban areas.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Google had recently <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/14/google-acquires-titan-aerospace-the-drone-company-pursued-by-facebook/">acquired Titan Aerospace</a>,
which makes high-altitude, solar powered drones.</p>
      </li>
      <li>By the next year, they expect to be able to provide service in certain
areas/countries.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Microsoft is using its experience in Machine Learning and its own cloud platform, 
Azure, to provide a platform for building ‘predictive analytics solutions’</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Microsoft Azure Machine Learning, a fully-managed cloud service for building predictive analytics solutions, helps overcome the challenges most businesses have in deploying and using machine learning. How? By delivering a comprehensive machine learning service that has all the benefits of the cloud. In mere hours, with Azure ML, customers and partners can build data-driven applications to predict, forecast and change future outcomes – a process that previously took weeks and months.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>From the description, it appears that the streaming experience was as if the file was present locally.</li>
      <li>It had <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/04/25/streem-seed-funding/">raised $875m in funding
