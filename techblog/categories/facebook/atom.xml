    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a recently published study by Facebook : <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full">Experimental evidence of
massive-scale emotional contagion through social
networks</a>, they disclosed
that for a week in 2012 they experimented with a set of ~700k English
speaking users, such that some had posts with negative emotions
deprioritized, while some had those with emotions deprioritized.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The experiment was aimed at exploring the impact of the emotional nature
of the posts in the feed on the behavior and emotions of the user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This has caused a huge stir in the media and has raised questions about
the ethics of A/B testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While some argue that Facebook didn’t have the rights to perform such a
test, by accepting their terms and conditions we agree to let them use
our data in this form.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moreover, this is not the first time a company has conducted an A/B test
on its users. While in most other cases, the tests are aimed at finding
the environment which gets the best returns, even they can be interpreted
as a ‘psychological experiment’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Response by Facebook’s employee, Adam Kramer (one of the 
authors of the paper)</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>OK so. A lot of people have asked me about my and Jamie and Jeff’s recent study published in PNAS, and I wanted to give a brief public explanation. The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product. We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends’ negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn’t clearly state our motivations in the paper.</p></p><p>        <p>Regarding methodology, our research sought to investigate the above claim by very minimally deprioritizing a small percentage of content in News Feed (based on whether there was an emotional word in the post) for a group of people (about 0.04% of users, or 1 in 2500) for a short period (one week, in early 2012). Nobody’s posts were “hidden,” they just didn’t show up on some loads of Feed. Those posts were always visible on friends’ timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads. And we found the exact opposite to what was then the conventional wisdom: Seeing a certain kind of emotion (positive) encourages it rather than suppresses is.</p></p><p>        <p>And at the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it — the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week.</p></p><p>        <p>The goal of all of our research at Facebook is to learn how to provide a better service. Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone. I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused. In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.</p></p><p>        <p>While we’ve always considered what research we do carefully, we (not just me, several other researchers at Facebook) have been working on improving our internal review practices. The experiment in question was run in early 2012, and we have come a long way since then. Those review practices will also incorporate what we’ve learned from the reaction to this paper</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>According to their study, there was a measurable, however small, impact
on the users and there was a network effect( those who felt more
negatively because of their feed shared negative feelings and passed on
the effect).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While it is unclear how severe the impact was, it would be disastrous for
Facebook’s reputation if it is discovered that their study resulted in
serious consequences.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The malware, dubbed ‘Energetic Bear’, targets energy and utility
companies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The attack has been going on for 18 months</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>According to the Financial Times, the malware “allows its operators to monitor energy consumption in real time, or to cripple physical systems such as wind turbines, gas pipelines and power plants at will.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Capabilities of the malware :
        <ul>
          <li>Access information on the victim’s computer networks </li>
          <li>Steal data, collect passwords, take screenshots and even download and run files</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>Symantec, the makers of the Norton suite, says the malware’s “main motive appears to be cyberespionage” but doesn’t mention any major shutdowns<br/>  …<br/> 		Symantec says that the attackers—who they call Dragonfly—is almost certainly “based in eastern Europe and has all the markings of being state-sponsored.” Markers in the malware, like timestamps and Cyrillic, suggest that it originated in Russia.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>
        <p>About Stuxnet </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Back in June 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>
was discovered and it was blamed for the decimation of Iranian
nuclear facilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Until <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/edward-snowden-u-s-israel-co-wrote-cyber-super-weapon-stuxnet/">Snowden confirmed the
suspicion</a>,
there were speculations that the worm was created by USA and Israel.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stuxnet not only had the ability to jump inconspicuously from
computer to computer, until it founds its way into the nuclear
facilities’ network, but it could also mutate itself to avoid
detection.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Once inside the required computers, it could manipulate motors at the
facilities to make the spin faster than they should and also ensure
that no alarm was raised because of it. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="russia-ban"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/02/russia-moves-to-ban-online-services-that-dont-store-personal-data-in-russia/">Russia Moves To Ban Online Services That Don’t Store Personal Data In Russia</a>
 <blockquote><p>… the Russian State Duma (parliament) passed the first bill requiring that the personal data of all Russians should be stored inside the country.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>As a consequence of the bill, post September 2016, services like Facebook, Google or any international service would have to host 
their servers within Russian borders.
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, these non-Russian companies would not be allowed to send data outside the country unless they can provide certain guarantees on data storage inside the country. For those who do not, the state telecommunications agency Roskomnadzor will require carriers to restrict access to those services.</p></p><p>        <p>The bill also proposes amendments to laws covering personal information and data protection.</p></blockquote> </p>
      </li>
      <li>China is known to impose such restrictions on the Internet. While earlier it was seen as an opposition to free speech, now it can be
easily justified as a move to protect the data from evesdropping by NSA.</li>
      <li>Not only is this an indication of the tightening of regulations around the Internet around the world, but also how revelations of 
NSA’s snooping is affecting those regulations. Such regulations will severely impact the operations of the companies involved 
and could lead to further tougher laws restricting freedom of speech.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Recently, Facebook <a href="http://newsroom.fb.com/news/2014/06/making-ads-better-and-giving-people-more-control-over-the-ads-they-see/">announced</a>		<br />
that to be able to deliver ads to the users, it would track
their activities across the web. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Although Facebook offers a way to opt-out, the terms aren’t 
very clear and it looks like a temporary solution.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Adblock Plus will
<a href="https://adblockplus.org/blog/about-that-facebook-tracking-thing">now</a>

    <ul>
      <li>Facebook has been trying to disaggregate mains parts of their data center
to provide more flexibility. Components can be separately upgraded and
congigured for optimal performance.</li>
      <li>Until now, they had succeeded with compute, server and storage, but the
traditional switches were being used.</li>
      <li>Wedge, the new top-of-rack switch, breaks that.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Hardware and software components are broken into modules.
<blockquote><p>The central modular hardware feature of Wedge is the OCP “Group Hug” motherboard, originally developed for microservers. A single Group Hug board can accommodate Intel, AMD or ARM processors.</p></p><p>        <p>Besides configurability, using a server board makes the box behave less like a switch and more like a server. “It basically takes the switch and it turns the switch into … another server,” Parikh said.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Facebook also designed FBOSS, a linux based OS, to make use of libraries
and systems to manage their fleet of servers.
<blockquote><p>FBOSS also puts an abstraction layer on top of the ASIC APIs of the switch which enables its engineers to treat it like they treat any other service in Facebook. “With FBOSS, all our infrastructure software engineers instantly become network engineers,” Bachar and Simpkins wrote.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>The design of the data switch will eventually be shared as part of its
<a href="http://www.opencompute.org/">Open Compute Project</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="fb-android"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/19/facebook-for-android/">Facebook Saves Developing World’s Data Plans With 65% Smaller, 50% More Efficient Android App</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Having reached most of the market in the developed countries, Facebook is
trying to reach out in the emerging markets.</li>
      <li>While Android is a good platform for that, it also poses the issue that 
these markets have several low-end devices and expensive data plans. </li>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://code.facebook.com/posts/485459238254631/improving-facebook-on-android">Facebook has improved their Android app to counter these problems</a>
<blockquote><p>To help accomplish this goal, a team of product managers and engineers traveled to Africa to examine mobile performance in developing countries. We purchased several different Android handsets to test the latest version of the Facebook app – and the testing process proved to be difficult. The combination of an intermittent, low-bandwidth network connection and a lack of memory space on the devices resulted in slow load times and constant crashes. We even burned through our monthly data plans in 40 minutes.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Performance (start times reduced by more than 50%)
  <blockquote><p>we found that start times were slower on single-core devices because too many features concurrently initialized themselves on application startup. We made sure to defer these initializations until after startup and, in some cases, until the features are used.</p></p><p>        <p>We also wanted the stories in News Feed to load faster. In order to rapidly display cached content on poor networks, we now fetch stories earlier in the process to allow more time to set up connections and download News Feed. The cold start path has been automated to ensure that we prevent further regressions in these areas.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Data efficiency (because data is expensive in developing countries)
        <ul>
          <li>After trying alternatives, settled on WebP compression format for
image transmission.
  <blockquote><p>The use of WebP for transmitting Facebook images resulted in data savings of 25 to 35 percent compared with JPG, and 80 percent compared with PNG. This all happened without perceived impact on quality.</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>Instead of loading images at high resolution, load only resolution
equivalent to the size of the viewport in which the images will appear.</li>
          <li>Higher resolution image requested/downloaded only when someone wants
to zoom-in on an image.</li>
          <li>Fine tuned caching strategies and sizes to minimize evictions for 
images that could be accessed again.
  <blockquote><p>The work on data efficiency resulted in a 50 percent reduction in data use compared with earlier last year.</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Networking
        <ul>
          <li>Current stack (<a href="http://square.github.io/okhttp/">OkHttp</a>) allowed
fast retries for intermittent network situations.</li>
          <li>Tried to decrease the number of reports regarding failed image loads
in News Feed. </li>
          <li>Fine tuned image pre-fetching algorithms and altered the process through
which the images are queued for download. </li>
          <li>Ensured that the images expected to be downloaded next are prioritized and no image
is stuck in queue for long.
  <blockquote><p>In combination with better data usage for images, reports of slow or failed image loads dropped by almost 90 percent over the past year.</p></blockquote></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Application size
        <ul>
          <li>Reduced application size by using Google Play’s options to provide 
different APKs for different OS versions and screen resolutions.</li>
          <li>Code of features or resources not supported on certain devices have
been excluded to reduce the size of the app.</li>

      <li>Apparently, this was not because of any attack on the system, but because
of an internal error. </li>
      <li>
        <p>Statement from Facebook</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Late last night, we ran into an issue while updating the configuration of one of our software systems. Not long after we made the change, some people started to have trouble accessing Facebook. We quickly spotted and fixed the problem, and in less than 30 minutes Facebook was back to 100% for everyone. This doesn’t happen often, but when it does we make sure we learn from the experience so we can make Facebook that much more reliable. Nothing is more important to us than making sure Facebook is there when people need it, and we apologize to anyone who may have had trouble connecting last night.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code Spaces, a source code hosting provider, has <a href="http://www.codespaces.com/?hackernews">posted the details of the attack</a>
that has caused them to go out of business.</li>
      <li>A DDOS attack started on 17th June and a hacker, who also gained access
to their Amazon EC2 control panel, left an email address for them to contact
through which they demanded a large some of money to stop the attack.</li>
      <li>
        <p>While their team tried to mitigate the attack and tried to regain control
of their control panel, the hacker caused a lot of damage.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>At this point we took action to take control back of our panel by changing passwords, however the intruder had prepared for this and had already created a number of backup logins to the panel and upon seeing us make the attempted recovery of the account he proceeded to randomly delete artifacts from the panel. We finally managed to get our panel access back but not before he had removed all EBS snapshots, S3 buckets, all AMI’s, some EBS instances and several machine instances.</p></p><p>        <p>In summary, most of our data, backups, machine configurations and offsite backups were either partially or completely deleted.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As a consequence, …</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Code Spaces will not be able to operate beyond this point, the cost of resolving this issue to date and the expected cost of refunding customers who have been left without the service they paid for will put Code Spaces in a irreversible position both financially and in terms of on going credibility.</p></p><p>        <p>As such at this point in time we have no alternative but to cease trading and concentrate on supporting our affected customers in exporting any remaining data they have left with us</p></blockquote></p>

  <li><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/17/facebook-slingshot/">Facebook’s Slingshot challenges SnapChat with ‘Reply to Unlock’</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Facebook’s new app <a href="http://www.sling.me/">Slingshot</a> is being seen as a 
competitor to SnapChat. </li>
      <li>It lets you share photos and 15-second videos with users on Slingshot.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The content is meant to be ephemeral, much like SnapChat. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>As for what happens to your content, once everyone you’ve slinged something to views it, Facebook says it will delete the photo or video from its servers. There is a seven-day delay in case it has to investigate abuse reports, but the team says the content is gone after that. Whether users trust Facebook to keep its word is up to them. Past privacy missteps might scare people, but Facebook is under close scrutiny from the FTC to abide by the privacy policies it puts forward.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>An important catch in the app is that you can’t view the content shared 
by the user until you reply to it. (‘Reply to Unlock’)</li>
      <li>This aims to increase reciprocation and make everyone a content generator.</li>
      <li>Slingshot was born out of a hackathon. The motivation can be summarized by 
<blockquote><p>“My brothers are really not technical in any way”, Slingshot inventor and four-year Facebook Product Designer Joey Flynn tells me. “I’d take a photo, upload it in iMessage, and send it to them. And I would just see “Seen”, or in a month I’d see them and they‘d say ‘that was a cool photo’. But hey, I want to see what you’re up to! There was this missing reciprocation” he explains. That was the spark for Slingshot.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>This app was <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/09/slingshot-app/">earlier released on app stored by mistake</a></li>
      <li>Facebook had tried to buy off SnapChat, but <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/13/us-facebook-snapchat-idUSBRE9AC11E20131113">SnapChat had rejected the $3 billion buyout offer</a></li>

    <p><strong><a href="http://matasano.com/articles/javascript-cryptography/">Browser based javascript cryptography considered harmful</a></strong></p>

    <p>Some of the things pointed out in the article. <em>[Not being an expert in cryptography, I would recommend readers to read
   the original article to avoid any miscommunication]</em></p>

    <ul>
      <li>Code could be injected when in transit. Can use SSL/TLS to avoid that, but 
then, in most cases, you could simply avoid cryptography at 
user end.</li>
      <li>There’s no certainty of information being removed from memory.</li>
      <li>It is not possible to verify the code/environment to be exactly as it is 
required to be. </li>
      <li>Javascript lacks a Cryptographically Secure Pseudo-Random Number Generator (CSPRNG). </li>
      <li><a href="https://crypto.stanford.edu/sjcl/">Stanford Javascript Crypto library (SJCL)</a>
developed at Stanford is a great work, but still insecure.
<blockquote><p>The authors of SJCL themselves say, “Unfortunately, this is not as great as in desktop applications because it is not feasible to completely protect against code injection, malicious servers and side-channel attacks.” That last example is a killer: what they’re really saying is, “we don’t know enough about Javascript runtimes to know whether we can securely host cryptography on them”. Again, that’s painful-but-tolerable in a server-side application, where you can always call out to native code as a workaround. It’s death to a browser.</p></blockquote></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.privacyinternational.org/press-releases/uk-intelligence-forced-to-reveal-secret-policy-for-mass-surveillance-of-residents">UK intelligence forced to reveal secret policy for mass surveillance of
residents’ Facebook and Google
use</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Secret policy define UK residents’ communication on Facebook, Google, Twitter, etc.
as ‘external communication’ because they use platforms based in the US, even
if the communication is between two people in the UK.</li>
      <li>This grants the secret services to indiscriminately intercept communication
on these platforms.</li>
      <li>For an ‘internal communication’, a warrant would be required, however that 
is not the case with ‘external communication’.
<blockquote><p>The Government believes that, even when privacy violations happen, it is not an “active intrusion” because the analyst reading or listening to an individual’s communication will inevitably forget about it anyway.</p></blockquote></li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/16/dropbox-has-quietly-acquired-parastructure-a-big-data-startup-in-stealth/">Dropbox acquired Parastructure, a Big Data Startup</a></strong>
 -
 <blockquote><p>So what exactly is Parastructure? According to the company’s LinkedIn profile, and its (now-offline) home page, it builds “beautiful data analysis software powered by cutting-edge open source infrastructure.” Parastructure’s GitHub pages give some clues as to what that data-analysis software was tackling, with areas covering Spark for cluster computing; Phoenix, a SQL skin over HBase; CrunchBase; and so on</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>The acquisition was done quite stealthily.</li>
      <li>Probably, Dropbox requires the software and the team to analyze its data</li>
      <li>Parastructure was an enterprise oriented startup and its acquisition indicates 
Dropbox’s intention on strengthening their image as an enterprise product.</li>
      <li>Dropbox’s increased effort in <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/business">Dropbox for
Business</a> brings it in direct
competition with Box, which is currently leading as an enterprise
solution.</li>
      <li>Both the companies are quite aggressively acquiring companies. </li>
      <li>In fact, Parastructure was acquired on the same day as 
<a href="/techblog/2014/06/17/tech-news-about-qeexos-fingersense-wristify-loon/">Box acquired Streem</a></li>
