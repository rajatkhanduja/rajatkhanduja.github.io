    <p><blockquote><p>If this campaign succeeds, the money will let me dedicate the time needed to bring this next, drastically improved, version of Xiki to the world. Xiki plugins for Sublime and Vim will be created. The installer and initial user experience will be greatly improved (largely by adding contextual menus everywhere). The integration with the shell will be improved. To enable supporting new Xiki plugins, the core of Xiki will be refactored. It will do the heavy lifting so the plugins will no longer have to.</p></blockquote></p>

        <p><a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/">RakNet</a> is a cross-platform C++ network engine for game development. 
 <blockquote><p>The tech is tuned for cross-platform, high-performance applications that operate across a wide variety of network types. Key features include object replication, remote procedure calls, patching, secure connections, voice chat, and real-time SQL logging. The technology has been licensed by thousands of indie developers, as well as companies like Unity, Havok, Mojang, Maxis and Sony Online Entertainment.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The core idea of <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/">Inbox</a> is to help developers exploit email as a platform without the hassles of archaic 
protocols like IMAP and SMTP. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“I actually wrote my thesis at MIT on email tools, and discovered how difficult it was to add features to email apps,” explains Grinich [co-founded] of how Inbox came to be. “One big issue was the underlying plumbing – IMAP, MIME, character encodings, etc. – which is what Inbox fixes for developers.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inbox provide <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs">REST APIs</a> to retrieve, modify and send emails. It also provides APIs for complex tasks like 
custom filtering, accessing attachments, creating drafts, etc.</p>

        <p>Founded by MIT Alums.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The company was co-founded by MIT alums, Michael Grinich, previously an engineer at Dropbox and designer Nest, and Christine Spang, an early Linux kernel engineer at Ksplice (acquired by Oracle.) The core team at Inbox also includes several other MIT alums, plus those with experience from Google and Firebase, as well as two graduates from the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT CSAIL, which spun out Meraki (acquired by Cisco).</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Carolina Healthcare Systems is buying credit-card data of its customers to be able to better predict the chances of them getting ill 
and provide them with relevant care and advice before that happens.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By tracking expenses, they hope to be able to get insights into their habits. This can provide much more information than can be 
attained by the little time the doctor gets to assess a patient.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>For a patient with asthma, the hospital would be able to assess how likely he is to arrive at the emergency room by looking at whether he’s refilled his asthma medication at the pharmacy, has been buying cigarettes at the grocery store, and lives in an area with a high pollen count, Dulin says. The system may also look at the probability of someone having a heart attack by considering factors such as the type of foods she buys and if she has a gym membership. “The idea is to use Big Data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels,” he says.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While the supporters argue that such data is already used to targetted advertising and this is a much better use of the same information,
there are a lot of privacy concerns around the use of data for health tracking and unsolicited help.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“It is one thing to have a number I can call if I have a problem or question; it is another thing to get unsolicited phone calls. I don’t like that,” says Jorjanne Murry, an accountant in Charlotte who has Type 1 diabetes and says she usually ignores calls from her health insurer trying to discuss her daily habits. “I think it is intrusive.”</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>
        <p>The study</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard and the movement of the leaf in 
response to the chewing was measured and recorded, using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations were played back to a set of plants, while only silence was played back on the other.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were later fed on these plants.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Findings</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>“What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said. “This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How can it be used?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><blockquote><p>“Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,” Appel said. “This research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.”</p></blockquote></p>

      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While it doesn’t claim to be perfect, it claims to offer greater security and anonymity than conventional e-mail and Web forms
by minimizing digital trails left by the communication between the provider and Washington Post.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It relies on Tor and requires the user to access <strong>http://vbmwh445kf3fs2v4.onion</strong>, preferably using a Tor browser. From the URL,

    <title type="html"><![CDATA[Docspad SDK]]></title>
    <link href="http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/05/01/docspad-sdk/"/>
    <updated>2014-05-01T16:46:51+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/05/01/docspad-sdk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In an <a href="/techblog/2014/03/12/hasjob-plus-docspad/">earlier post</a>, I had
discussed how I integrated <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad API</a> with
<a href="http://hasjob.co">Hasjob</a>.  As there was no Docspad SDK at that time, its
absence made me realize their importance. Having to deal with raw API calls,
these were the primary problems that I faced, which I thought could be resolved
by a Software Development Kit (SDK) :-</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>API lets me talk to your tool, but not in my language</strong></p>

    <p>Say I am developing in Python and I have a dictionary of parameters explaining 
 all that I need the API to do, but the API doesn’t understand the dictionary!
 I would need to convert all those parameters and variables in GET/POST variables
 that before I can get the task done. Moreover, the conventions in your API
 might be extremely different from those of my project, making things worse.</p>

    <p>Certainly, I could work around that by wrapping around your API, which brings
 me to the next point.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Managing network calls and errors is annoying</strong></p>

    <p>There are API errors and then there are network/connection errors, timeouts
 and what not. The last thing I need when dealing with a project idea is to
 get stuck understanding what an error code means. SDKs not only help translate
 the content in the developer’s language, but also the errors. An exception
 that describes the error makes it easy for the developer to handle
 certain edge cases without the program blowing up in the users’ face.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>SDKs provide code samples</strong></p>

    <p>Even if a developer doesn’t need the entire SDK, either because he only
 requires to make a few calls to the API or he/she does not think the SDK
 interacts well with his tool, an openly available SDK still provides code
 samples to the developer to help him/her manage basic things. Be it managing
 errors or creating request URLs, SDKs can act as a good demonstration of how
 the APIs must be used.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sniketh">Niketh</a> had already been planning to release SDKs
himself, so when I suggested it to him, he was eager to get started! Soon
<!--more-->
after, I began working on a Python SDK as I already had written some <a href="https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/hasjob/commit/45945f1cbad17dbc03839388a05cacb0bbf3d07b">code to
wrap around Docspad API while integrating with
Hasjob</a>.
For inspiration and ideas about how a SDK should be structured, I looked at
other popular SDKs, especially the <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/sdks/python">Dropbox
SDKs</a>. </p>

<p>Once we had worked out the design and structure of the <a href="https://github.com/bookpad/docspad-sdk-python">Python
SDK</a>, we aimed to keep other SDKs
quite similar so as to have a common interface throughout languages. However, as 
different languaes have different programming idioms and conventions, having 
the <em>exact same</em> interface across languages would beat the purpose by forcing
the developers to think in terms of another language. As a result, while the
basic ideas and interface remains similar across languages, there are minor 
differences.</p>

<p>With <a href="https://twitter.com/ajayn1609">Ajay’s</a> help, we have been able to release
an entire <a href="https://github.com/Bookpad/?query=docspad-sdk">arsenal of SDKs</a> for
<a href="https://github.com/bookpad/docspad-sdk-php">PHP</a>,
<a href="https://github.com/bookpad/docspad-sdk-java">Java</a> and
<a href="https://github.com/bookpad/docspad-sdk-ruby">Ruby</a> developers as well.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>For all the PHP developers out there, we have officially released our PHP SDK, Happy Hacking <a href="https://t.co/BHvmu7623g">https://t.co/BHvmu7623g</a> !!</p>&mdash; Bookpad Inc (@bookpadinc) <a href="https://twitter.com/bookpadinc/statuses/450967924216692736">April 1, 2014</a></blockquote>
<script async="" src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p>So how do our SDKs solve the problems discussed in the beginning? Using the
Ruby SDK, for instance, this is how one could write a program to upload a
document, create a new session, get a view url and then delete the document.</p>

<p>Note how not only the developer doesn’t need to care about the details of the
network call, such as URL and the POST parameters, he is also freed of the hassle
of checking and managing all the errors that could arise. Moreover, with little
documentation available with the methods, a developer can get started
integrating the API into his project, without going through the entire <a href="http://bookpad.in/developer/gettingstarted">API
documentation</a> and preparing
himself for all kinds of response the API could return.</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Get yourself an <a href="http://docspad.com/signup/freetrial">API
key</a> now and jump start your Docspad
integration with the SDKs. For issues or bugs with the SDKs, you could use the
issue tracker on Github or reach out to Docspad
(<a href="https://twitter.com/docspadofficial">@docspadofficial</a>) on Twitter [or just
drop by and say Hi]. If you are looking for SDK for some other language or have something to say about the post, leave a comment below.</p>

    <link href="http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/03/12/hasjob-plus-docspad/"/>
    <updated>2014-03-12T00:06:09+05:30</updated>
    <id>http://rajatkhanduja.com/techblog/2014/03/12/hasjob-plus-docspad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>About two months ago, <a href="http://twitter.com/sniketh">Niketh</a> came up with an idea
to augment the job application process on <a href="https://hasjob.co">Hasjob</a>.  Having
made the quite awesome product, <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad</a> for handling
documents in web applications, he certainly noticed the lack of the option to
let a job applicant upload a CV while applying through Hasjob. While the user
could add details about himself/herself in a text field, nothing tells as much
about an applicant as a personalized CV. As the <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob">code for the website is open
sourced</a> and written in Python, I took this
opportunity to check out the <a href="http://docspad.com/documentation/gettingstarted">Docspad
APIs</a> and spend a weekend
contributing to a Python based open source project! </p>

<p>But before I dive into the task and the experience, let’s first discuss more about 
Hasjob and Docspad.</p>

<p>Hasjob is <a href="http://hasgeek.com">HasGeek</a>’s job board. Hasgeek, based out of
Bangalore, is known for organizing technology events for geeks and developers
in India. Some of these events include Hackathons and
<a href="https://hacknight.in">Hacknights</a>, which are loved among the geeks. HasGeek
lives up to its name by providing the source code to their website and its
components under open source licenses on <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/">Github</a>.</p>

<p>With the goal of making digital content more accessible, Niketh and
<a href="https://twitter.com/bandiaditya">Aditya</a> founded <a href="http://bookpad.in">Bookpad</a>
(<a href="http://twitter.com/bookpadinc">@bookpadinc</a>). <a href="http://docspad.com">Docspad</a> is
their first product, which provides an easy solution for developers to make
applications with document handling capabilities. The set of APIs make it easy
for a developer to provide users with the option to upload and view documents
through the web browser on any device ranging from mobile to desktop.
<!--more--></p>

<p>Now, the primary task was to provide a job applicant with the option to upload
a document as his CV and allow the employer to view the same. Moreover, we
wanted the integration to make as little changes to the current workflow and
code architecture.  The reason behind this was two-fold : </p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>allow seamless transition to the new workflow.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>avoid making changes to the database layer or code architecture to make it
easy to integrate and make it live at the earliest.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>As a result, we settled on providing the user the option to upload a PDF, DOC
or a DOCX file while filling up the rest of the application. To avoid making
changes to the database layer, this document is only temporarily stored on the
HasJob server until it is uploaded to Docspad.  Thereafter, a URL based on the
<code>docid</code> returned by Docspad Upload API is simply attached to the
<code>apply_message</code> field, which is the one that the employer receives in an email
allowing the employer to view the document with or without downloading it to
his device. The Docspad HTML5 based viewer can be embeded right into the
application, allowing us to let the user view the uploaded content from within
Hasjob’s website. </p>

<p>This process is quite simple to code, made simpler by the quite flexible 
<a href="http://flask.pocoo.org">Flask microframework</a> used for the Hasjob site along
with the easy Docspad API.</p>

<p>Some highlights of the project were :- </p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Wrapping around Docspad API</strong></p>

    <p>Since Docspad didn’t have any publicly available SDKs at the time, I began
by building a wrapper around the APIs. <a href="https://github.com/rajatkhanduja/hasjob/commit/45945f1cbad17dbc03839388a05cacb0bbf3d07b">This code</a>
later became the boilerplate for a <a href="https://github.com/Bookpad/docspad-sdk-python">Python SDK for Docspad</a>,
which will soon be stable. SDKs for several other languages and platforms
are in the pipeline too. SDKs not only make it easier to build applications
on, but also provide sample code for using the APIs for those who like to
build their own tools.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Lastuser and HasGeek Auth</strong></p>

    <p>HasGeek uses <a href="http://auth.hasgeek.com">HasGeek Auth</a> for authorization and
user management for its sites. It is powered by <a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/lastuser">Lastuser</a>,
which has been developed by HasGeek themselves! At that time, I was still 
getting to know more about HasGeek’s open sourced components and was quite
impressed with their dedication to sharing all these tools that they had
developed. </p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>In the end, it turned out to be a great weekend project and let me get
acquainted with Flask and Docspad API. Now, every time I encounter a site that
doesn’t provide good support for uploading/viewing documents, I wonder all the
things they could do with the API! In fact, there are several other job portals
that could make use of the API in quite the same way. </p>

<p>While I didn’t follow up much after sending them the
<a href="https://github.com/hasgeek/hasjob/pull/81">pull request</a>, Niketh has been in
touch with them and informs me that they are quite pleased with the
implementation. Eagerly awaiting for the integration to go live! </p>
