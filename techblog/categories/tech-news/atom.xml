    <p><blockquote><p>If this campaign succeeds, the money will let me dedicate the time needed to bring this next, drastically improved, version of Xiki to the world. Xiki plugins for Sublime and Vim will be created. The installer and initial user experience will be greatly improved (largely by adding contextual menus everywhere). The integration with the shell will be improved. To enable supporting new Xiki plugins, the core of Xiki will be refactored. It will do the heavy lifting so the plugins will no longer have to.</p></blockquote></p>

      <li>
        <p><a href="http://www.jenkinssoftware.com/">RakNet</a> is a cross-platform C++ network engine for game development. 
 <blockquote><p>The tech is tuned for cross-platform, high-performance applications that operate across a wide variety of network types. Key features include object replication, remote procedure calls, patching, secure connections, voice chat, and real-time SQL logging. The technology has been licensed by thousands of indie developers, as well as companies like Unity, Havok, Mojang, Maxis and Sony Online Entertainment.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>After using it internally for quite some time, Oculus has now <a href="https://github.com/OculusVR/RakNet">open sourced RakNet</a> under BSD License.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>They announced their own developer conference <a href="http://www.oculusvr.com/connect/">Oculus Connect</a> “that brings together engineers,
designers, and creatives from around the world to share and collaborate in the interest of creating the best virtual reality experiences
possible.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Oculus Connect is scheduled for September 19-20 and attendee applications will open on July 10th.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It would be a great conference for all those interested in VR, especially in Oculus’s products.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Attendees will be the first to learn about upcoming Oculus technology, with sessions and workshops led by Oculus engineers and industry pioneers. Developers at the event will also have opportunities to receive design and engineering feedback directly from the Oculus team in hands-on labs.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The core idea of <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/">Inbox</a> is to help developers exploit email as a platform without the hassles of archaic 
protocols like IMAP and SMTP. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“I actually wrote my thesis at MIT on email tools, and discovered how difficult it was to add features to email apps,” explains Grinich [co-founded] of how Inbox came to be. “One big issue was the underlying plumbing – IMAP, MIME, character encodings, etc. – which is what Inbox fixes for developers.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inbox provide <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs">REST APIs</a> to retrieve, modify and send emails. It also provides APIs for complex tasks like 
custom filtering, accessing attachments, creating drafts, etc.</p>

        <p>Founded by MIT Alums.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The company was co-founded by MIT alums, Michael Grinich, previously an engineer at Dropbox and designer Nest, and Christine Spang, an early Linux kernel engineer at Ksplice (acquired by Oracle.) The core team at Inbox also includes several other MIT alums, plus those with experience from Google and Firebase, as well as two graduates from the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT CSAIL, which spun out Meraki (acquired by Cisco).</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Carolina Healthcare Systems is buying credit-card data of its customers to be able to better predict the chances of them getting ill 
and provide them with relevant care and advice before that happens.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By tracking expenses, they hope to be able to get insights into their habits. This can provide much more information than can be 
attained by the little time the doctor gets to assess a patient.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>For a patient with asthma, the hospital would be able to assess how likely he is to arrive at the emergency room by looking at whether he’s refilled his asthma medication at the pharmacy, has been buying cigarettes at the grocery store, and lives in an area with a high pollen count, Dulin says. The system may also look at the probability of someone having a heart attack by considering factors such as the type of foods she buys and if she has a gym membership. “The idea is to use Big Data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels,” he says.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While the supporters argue that such data is already used to targetted advertising and this is a much better use of the same information,
there are a lot of privacy concerns around the use of data for health tracking and unsolicited help.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“It is one thing to have a number I can call if I have a problem or question; it is another thing to get unsolicited phone calls. I don’t like that,” says Jorjanne Murry, an accountant in Charlotte who has Type 1 diabetes and says she usually ignores calls from her health insurer trying to discuss her daily habits. “I think it is intrusive.”</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The study</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard and the movement of the leaf in 
response to the chewing was measured and recorded, using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations were played back to a set of plants, while only silence was played back on the other.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were later fed on these plants.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Findings</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>“What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said. “This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How can it be used?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><blockquote><p>“Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,” Appel said. “This research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.”</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a recently published study by Facebook : <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full">Experimental evidence of
massive-scale emotional contagion through social
networks</a>, they disclosed
that for a week in 2012 they experimented with a set of ~700k English
speaking users, such that some had posts with negative emotions
deprioritized, while some had those with emotions deprioritized.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The experiment was aimed at exploring the impact of the emotional nature
of the posts in the feed on the behavior and emotions of the user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This has caused a huge stir in the media and has raised questions about
the ethics of A/B testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While some argue that Facebook didn’t have the rights to perform such a
test, by accepting their terms and conditions we agree to let them use
our data in this form.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moreover, this is not the first time a company has conducted an A/B test
on its users. While in most other cases, the tests are aimed at finding
the environment which gets the best returns, even they can be interpreted
as a ‘psychological experiment’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Response by Facebook’s employee, Adam Kramer (one of the 
authors of the paper)</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>OK so. A lot of people have asked me about my and Jamie and Jeff’s recent study published in PNAS, and I wanted to give a brief public explanation. The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product. We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends’ negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn’t clearly state our motivations in the paper.</p></p><p>        <p>Regarding methodology, our research sought to investigate the above claim by very minimally deprioritizing a small percentage of content in News Feed (based on whether there was an emotional word in the post) for a group of people (about 0.04% of users, or 1 in 2500) for a short period (one week, in early 2012). Nobody’s posts were “hidden,” they just didn’t show up on some loads of Feed. Those posts were always visible on friends’ timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads. And we found the exact opposite to what was then the conventional wisdom: Seeing a certain kind of emotion (positive) encourages it rather than suppresses is.</p></p><p>        <p>And at the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it — the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week.</p></p><p>        <p>The goal of all of our research at Facebook is to learn how to provide a better service. Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone. I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused. In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.</p></p><p>        <p>While we’ve always considered what research we do carefully, we (not just me, several other researchers at Facebook) have been working on improving our internal review practices. The experiment in question was run in early 2012, and we have come a long way since then. Those review practices will also incorporate what we’ve learned from the reaction to this paper</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>According to their study, there was a measurable, however small, impact
on the users and there was a network effect( those who felt more
negatively because of their feed shared negative feelings and passed on
the effect).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While it is unclear how severe the impact was, it would be disastrous for
Facebook’s reputation if it is discovered that their study resulted in
serious consequences.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The malware, dubbed ‘Energetic Bear’, targets energy and utility
companies.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The attack has been going on for 18 months</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>According to the Financial Times, the malware “allows its operators to monitor energy consumption in real time, or to cripple physical systems such as wind turbines, gas pipelines and power plants at will.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Capabilities of the malware :
        <ul>
          <li>Access information on the victim’s computer networks </li>
          <li>Steal data, collect passwords, take screenshots and even download and run files</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>Symantec, the makers of the Norton suite, says the malware’s “main motive appears to be cyberespionage” but doesn’t mention any major shutdowns<br/>  …<br/> 		Symantec says that the attackers—who they call Dragonfly—is almost certainly “based in eastern Europe and has all the markings of being state-sponsored.” Markers in the malware, like timestamps and Cyrillic, suggest that it originated in Russia.</p></blockquote></p>

        <p>About Stuxnet </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Back in June 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>
was discovered and it was blamed for the decimation of Iranian
nuclear facilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Until <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/edward-snowden-u-s-israel-co-wrote-cyber-super-weapon-stuxnet/">Snowden confirmed the
suspicion</a>,
there were speculations that the worm was created by USA and Israel.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stuxnet not only had the ability to jump inconspicuously from
computer to computer, until it founds its way into the nuclear
facilities’ network, but it could also mutate itself to avoid
detection.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Once inside the required computers, it could manipulate motors at the
facilities to make the spin faster than they should and also ensure
that no alarm was raised because of it. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>

    <p><a name="russia-ban"></a><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/07/02/russia-moves-to-ban-online-services-that-dont-store-personal-data-in-russia/">Russia Moves To Ban Online Services That Don’t Store Personal Data In Russia</a>
 <blockquote><p>… the Russian State Duma (parliament) passed the first bill requiring that the personal data of all Russians should be stored inside the country.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>As a consequence of the bill, post September 2016, services like Facebook, Google or any international service would have to host 
their servers within Russian borders.
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, these non-Russian companies would not be allowed to send data outside the country unless they can provide certain guarantees on data storage inside the country. For those who do not, the state telecommunications agency Roskomnadzor will require carriers to restrict access to those services.</p></p><p>        <p>The bill also proposes amendments to laws covering personal information and data protection.</p></blockquote> </p>
      </li>

    <ul>
      <li>Google’s <a href="http://google.com/atap">Advanced Technology and Projects lab</a>
provided some interesting updates to <a href="http://projectara.com">Project Ara</a>
and <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project">Project Tango</a></li>
      <li>Project Ara, that began as a concept called (and propogated by) <a href="https://phonebloks.com">PhoneBloks</a> aiming to create a smartphone with modular units
allowing for increased customization and longer life of phones.</li>
      <li>At Google I/O, <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/26/google-project-ara-prototype/">a prototype of a phone by Project Ara was unveiled</a>
<blockquote><p>When Eremenko brought the prototype on stage during a breakout session of Google I/O at San Francisco’s Moscone Center and flashed the Android bootup screen, the audience went wild. Ultimately, the phone failed to fully load (though the crowd cheered anyway), and Eremenko said plenty of challenges lie ahead for Ara, including the challenge of building the tech into a beautiful design for consumers.</p></blockquote></li>

He received a hearty round of applause when he generated a 3D replica of the stage in real time using Tango’s depth cameras. He also demonstrated a few games on the device, and at one point crouched to his knees to interact with a small virtual wizard on the screen.</p></blockquote></p>

give police complete access to a suspect’s phone.</li>

and allows listeners/police to activate the microphone on Android, iOS

      </li>
      <li>Installing it on iOS requires a jailbroken phone, however it can be 
installed on Android without any root privileges. </li>
      <li>The app was made by a Milan-based company, <a href="http://www.hackingteam.com/">Hacking Team</a>
that has made a niche for itself selling surveillance software to 
police in several countries.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>In Google I/O, it was announced that <a href="/techblog/2014/06/26/tech-news-google-io-keynote/#chromecast">Chromecast would allow anyone in
the same room to share the screen without requiring them to be on the
same wifi. </a> </li>
      <li>In a post keynote presentation, it was cleared up that this was achieved
using Ultrasonic soundwaves. </li>
      <li>Once configured, Chromecast will push uniquely generated ultrasonic
waves through the TV’s speakers encoding information required by the
phone to pair up.</li>
      <li>Apps using Chromecast SDK will listen for these ultrasounds (relying on
the phone’s microphone) to detect and show the option to pair up
with Chromecast.</li>
      <li>Earlier this year, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/16/google-acquires-slicklogin-the-sound-based-password-alternative/">Google had acquired SlickLogin</a>, 
which used ultrasonic soundwaves to provide something like a 2-factor

    <ul>

        <p><a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/README.md">How does it work?</a></p>

        <p><blockquote><p>OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with someone. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the file. It doesn’t require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the file being sent is secret, one would want to use a secret
way to send over the aforementioned URL and <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works#otr">Off-the-Record encrypted
chat</a> is
recommended for that.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://cleartax.in/">ClearTax</a>, founded in 2011 and based in Delhi,
already has a strong presence in India automating the income tax filing
process for workers.</li>
      <li>Over 300,00 people used ClearTax last year to file their taxes. </li>
      <li>First company to join YCombinator that focuses on only the Indian market.</li>
      <li>
        <p>It is not a typical <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> launch</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>While their market opportunity is currently in India, ClearTax decided to join Y Combinator because the startup got access to “a set of resources we don’t get in India,” says founder Archit Gupta.</p></p><p>        <p>“We were missing some of the mentorship in India for example. I worked in Silicon Valley before. I was an engineer at Data Domain, which was acquired by EMC. So I had seen how being in the Valley is super useful, so that whole thing made it very, very clear to us that we should come out here.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Two of the cofounders, Anupam Mediratta and Archit Gupta, <a href="http://yourstory.com//2012/06/file-tax-online-cleartax/">graduated from
IIT Guwahati</a>,
while the third, RR Gupta, is a CA by profession with decades of
experience in taxation and accounting</li>
      <li>There are several companies in India that offer online tax services.</li>
      <li>
        <p>ClearTax, however, <a href="http://cleartax.in/Meta/Pricing">follows a freemium
model</a> where <a href="http://www.nextbigwhat.com/file-tax-returns-online-for-free-cleartax-297/">they can file their taxes
for free but pay to consult tax experts to get help on saving and
filing</a>.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>To use ClearTax, all someone needs to do is upload the form onto the website. Then ClearTax’s software automatically pulls out relevant data, so users don’t have to manually key in any numbers or information, and prepares tax forms for each user, a process the startup says can take as little as 15 minutes.<br/>Gupta says ClearTax’s main competitor is the government, which has its own online filing software, but that’s complicated to use, especially since people need to figure out which one out of seven tax forms they need to fill out</p></blockquote></p>

      <li><a href="http://www.justyo.co/">Yo!</a> made a lot of news recently when it received 
$1.2m in funding based on this app that sends across only a two letter
word, ‘Yo!’.</li>
      <li>The two-and-half hour hackathon was an attempt to prove that Yo could 
do much more than just send ‘Yo’ across to friends.</li>
      <li>Using <a href="http://yoapi.justyo.co/">its API</a>, people tried to create several
apps. </li>
      <li>Apps developed during the hackathon :-
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.yoserverisdown.com/">YoServerIsDown</a> allows users to sign
up for this service which will send a ‘Yo’ whenever their server is

          <li><a href="https://twitter.com/Noah_L/status/482731097940193280">YOaster</a> sends
a ‘Yo’ when the toaster has finished toasting the bread.</li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>As we can see from the above ideas, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/yo-yo/">‘Yo’ can meaning
anything</a>.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Venture investor (and husband of one of the world’s best-dressed billionaires) Marc Andreessen calls yo an example of one-bit communication – a message that only exists as itself. There is no meaning — the medium is, in fact, the message.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>After sharing that Google now has <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-now-has-1b-active-android-users/">1 billion 30-day active
users</a>
Sundar Pichai announced the Android One program which would help increase
the number significantly.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This initiative will target OEMs, specifically in emerging markets, to make
smartphones more affordable to develop and release.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>With Android One, Google is hoping to reduce the cost of smartphone development by identifying the components that go into a smartphone and to pre-qualify suppliers for those parts to ensure they work together.</p></p><p>        <p>On the software side, Google is giving hardware manufacturers access to its Play Store to help them add locally relevant apps to their devices. It’s also handling all the software updates automatically, just like it does for Nexus devices.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Three OEMs to start with : Micromax, Karbonn and Spice.</li>
      <li>Google is also trying to work with wireless providers to provide low cost
wireless plans.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><a name="material-design"></a><strong><a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/25/google-unveils-new-cross-platform-design-language-material-design/">Google Unveils New Cross Platform Design Language “Material Design”</a></strong>
    <ul>
      <li>As a part of the forthcoming, Android ‘L’ release of the Android OS, Google
announced a new universal design language, “Material Design”.
<blockquote><p>“We imagined… what if pixels didn’t just have color, but also depth? What if there was a material that could change its texture? This lead us to something we call ‘material design,” says Matias Durate, Director of Android operating system User Experience at Google…</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>The new framework is now <a href="http://www.google.com/design/">publicly available</a>.</li>
      <li>They aim is to put the framework out in the public to help create a consistent
user-experience for the different Android apps, much like Apple’s guidelines
for Mac and iOS developers.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Redesigned versions of their flagship products like GMail and Calendar will

<blockquote><p>Google describes the new design as being “inspired by the study of paper and ink, yet technologically advanced and open to imagination and magic.”</p></p><p>        <p>The design uses familiar tactile means of interacting with its many parts, with visual cues that are grounded in reality, Google says. Its elements also recall print-based design typography, with “deliberate color choices, edge-to-edge imagery, large-scale typography, and intentional white space create a bold and graphic interface that immerses the user in the experience.”</p></p><p>        <p>Motion is another key element of the design, but is meant to be. “Motion is meaningful and appropriate, serving to focus attention and maintain continuity,” Google adds.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Such a design centric update to Android was <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/19/a-sneak-peek-into-androids-future/">expected</a>
and several websites reported the internal project <a href="http://www.androidpolice.com/2014/06/11/exclusive-quantum-paper-and-googles-upcoming-effort-to-make-consistent-ui-simple/">‘Quantum’</a></li>
      <li>This move seems to show Google’s increased focus on user-experience and design, 
which seems to have been a distinguishing factor between iOS and Android devices.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Google demoed a feature that allows the user to skip logging into the phone
as the phone deduces if it is in a trusted environment.</li>
      <li>The phone looks for <em>your</em> smartphone or your Wifi network; if found, it

watches will go on sale
immediately</a>,
Google announced that it will be releasing <a href="http://developer.android.com/wear/index.html">Android Wear SDK for
developers</a> to build upon.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>… Google demoed several Android Wear functions that will be available on all Android Wear devices including swiping to dismiss messages and displaying contextual information relevant to the wearer.</p></blockquote></p>

      </li>
      <li>On stage, there was also an interesting demo of how the smartwatch showed
contextually relevant information. 
        <ul>
          <li>The wearer had a flight ticket for that day, which was displayed on the watch, like a Google Now card. </li>
          <li>One could see more information by tapping on it.</li>
          <li>An incoming message (on the phone) notification was shown on the watch and swiping it 
away also removed the notification from the phone.</li>
          <li>It was also able to give directions to a place and log/display the number
of steps taken by the wearer.</li>
          <li>Also, it was able to respond to voice commands like searching, responding
to a message and setting an alarm.</li>
        </ul>

        <iframe width="560" height="315" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/s_LYIQwwQVQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The SDK allows developers to create custom UI, allowing their apps to 
leverage the sensors, taps and voice commands on the smartwatches.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The company demoed an app from Eat24, for example, which would allow you to order a pizza from the watch within 30 seconds and just a few taps.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Besides LG and Samsung, they have some other partners. Moto 360 is expected
later this year. Other partners include Asus, Qualcomm, Intel and HTC.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Android Wear, for style, supports both square and round shaped watches. 
LG and Samsung’s first watches are square-shaped, while Moto360, will
be round shaped.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Referring to it as the ‘biggest screen in the house’, Google announced 
a new <a href="http://www.android.com/tv/">Android TV operating system</a>.</li>
      <li>It’s software (OS) that will be embedded into smart televisions by 
third party OEMs, much like the Android OS was used by smartphone
manufacturers</li>
      <li>Android TV will work with a number of chipsets and is designed to enable
developers to create apps using the same Android toolset they used for
phones and tablets.</li>
      <li>Android TV will play movies and TV shows and could be controlled by
phones, tablets and even smartwatches.</li>
      <li>Your smartphone or tablet could act as the controller for games played on
Android TV.</li>
      <li>It will have full Chromecast support, which itself received significant
updates, allowing users to beam content from their mobile devices to
their TV.</li>
      <li>This is not the first time Google is trying to enter the TV market. Earlier
attempts, including Google TV, didn’t succeed.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Lately, a lot of road accidents have been attributed to drivers fumbling 
with their phones. With the intention to change this and allow user to 
leverage the power of Android without losing sight of the road, Google
announced <a href="http://www.android.com/auto/">Android Auto</a></li>
      <li>Android-auto connects the user’s smartphone with the car, to provide 
context based information, navigation and notifications on a large-enough
screen on the dashboard.</li>
      <li>The user can interact with it using voice commands or keys on the steering.
While the touch based navigation still works, it’s not as bad as dealing
with the small screen of the phone.</li>
      <li>During the demo, they showed how a driver could start navigation to a 
destination through just voice commands. </li>
      <li>Integration with Google Now allows Android-auto to read your text messages 
out loud to you while you are driving and allows you to dictate and 
send a reply.</li>
      <li>25 car manufacturers have promised to build Android-Auto powered cars
and the first cars are expected to roll out by the end of this year.</li>
      <li>Android Auto SDK will be released soon.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Google demoed the new version of Chrome for the next Android version (Android ‘L’).
<blockquote><p>But it isn’t just a better version of Chrome. There is a clear and more profound message coming from Google. The company wants to blend native apps with web tabs. And the end of native apps as we know them could be closer than we might think.</p></blockquote></li>
      <li>App switcher now looks like Safari on iOS, with recent apps looking like
cards in a drawer.
<img class="center" src="http://tctechcrunch2011.files.wordpress.com/2014/06/img_00391.jpg?w=738" title="‘New app switcher’" ></li>
      <li>Each tab in Chrome gets is shown like a separate app!</li>
      <li>
        <p>Google has already been supporting <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2013/10/31/android-4-4-kitkat-app-indexing/">deep-links to other
applications</a>
through search results. For instance, if you searched for a book on Google Now,
the search result that links to Goodreads, could actually launched the
Goodreads app, letting you leverage the interface designed by Goodreads
for mobile. They are now expanding this feature to many more apps.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Knowing all this, imagine for a second what Android L will look like. You turn on your phone, search for something in Google using voice search on your home screen. It launches Chrome. You tap on the first search result, it launches a native app. You switch apps to read this article you found earlier in Chrome.</p></p><p>        <p>Back, and forth, and back, and forth between the web and native apps. After a while, you won’t even notice if you’re on the web or in a native app.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Google is possibly doing this because it has been traditionally centered
around web with most of its revenue coming from ads. </li>
      <li>It could be possible that in the future Google tries to make Android
a very thin OS layer letting all the apps be web-based. This would be 
something like <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/os/">Mozilla’s FirefoxOS</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WebOS">Palm’s WebOS</a></li>

    <ul>
      <li>The Android apps will essentially run in an emulator on the Chrome OS
Desktop and will be available in the launcher.</li>
      <li>No expected time was given for this feature, however, they did demo a
few apps (eg: Evernote) to show how it would work.</li>
      <li>They also seem to be looking at a tighter integration of Chrome OS and
Android. 
        <ul>
          <li>If you come close to your Chromebook with your phone, it will 
automatically log you in, skipping the authentication step.</li>
          <li>This is quite like the smartwatch unlocking your Android phone.</li>
          <li>Also, the notifications on your Android phone would be available on 
Chromebook as desktop notifications. Currently, this is possible
to achieve using a combination of app on Android and extension on
Google Chrome. <a href="https://www.pushbullet.com/">PushBullet</a>, too,

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/devices/chromecast/index.html">Chromecast</a>,
Google’s popular $35 dongle that plugs into your TV’s HDMI port, letting
you stream video and music to your television, received a number of
updates. </li>
      <li>
        <p>A new feature allows anyone to share the screen without the hassle of 
logging onto the same wifi network as the Chromecast enabled television.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“So how do we do that?,” asks Chandra. “We’re using a variety of technologies to confirm that you’re in the same room as the Chromecast. If for some reason we can’t automatically detect that, you can enter an on-screen PIN,” he explains.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>This would make it more convenient for some guest to share photos or 
videos on the TV.</li>
      <li>Another feature, Backdrop, lets you turn ‘the biggest screen’ in the house
into a photo frame of sorts when it is not being used otherwise.</li>
      <li>It lets you slide through your own photo albums (on Google+) or a random
set of images showing scenic landscapes, art, lifestyle, etc.</li>
      <li>
        <p>The Chromecast app on your mobile could be used to learn more about 
the images on screen (in case you like the image or want to know more
about it).</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>However, the standout feature in the Chromecast update is its new ability to allow any Android device to be mirrored, wirelessly, onto a TV. Google built its own framework for this, allowing it to cut down on the latency, Chandra said.<br/>During the demo, the company showed how you can switch this feature on from the settings, making everything on your phone immediately appear on the TV, including things like Google Earth and even your phone’s camera viewfinder – the latter which was aimed at the audience for a little frivolity before wrapping up the announcement.</p></blockquote></p>

Flow</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Cloud Dataflow is a fully managed service for creating data pipelines that ingest, transform and analyze data in both batch and streaming modes. Cloud Dataflow is a successor to MapReduce, and is based on our internal technologies like Flume and MillWheel. </p></p><p>        <p>Cloud Dataflow makes it easy for you to get actionable insights from your data while lowering operational costs without the hassles of deploying, maintaining or scaling infrastructure. You can use Cloud Dataflow for use cases like ETL, batch data processing and streaming analytics, and it will automatically optimize, deploy and manage the code and resources required.</p></blockquote></p>

this.</li>

bottlenecks in a live application. </li>
      <li>In the demo at I/O, they set a watchpoint in a live application to
to debug a ‘live call’. </li>
      <li>
        <p>Google Cloud Save provides a simple API to developers for saving, retrieving
 and synchronizing user data on the cloud and across devices without the
 need of any server code.</p>

        <p><a href="https://nest.com/works-with-nest">Works with Nest</a> is a program where
Nest (as an independent entity under Google) is allowing developers to
use Nest’s APIs to convey information to Nest and help create a ‘smart
home’ or ‘internet of things’. This video gives a good insight into their
vision and the direction they are headed.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>Mercedes-Benz
<blockquote><p>Your car can tell Nest when you’ll be home so your thermostat can start heating or cooling at exactly the right time. It keeps you from wasting energy, and means you’re comfortable as soon as you walk in the door.</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>
            <p>Whirlpool</p>

            <p><blockquote><p>If your Nest Thermostat notices you’re away, it can have Whirlpool switch to a refresh mode when your cycle ends, so your clothes stay fresh and wrinkle-free<br/>…<br/>If you’re signed up for Rush Hour Rewards with a participating energy provider, Nest can let Whirlpool know when an energy rush hour is about to happen, and your washer or dryer will delay the start of the cycle until the rush hour is over</p></blockquote></p>

          <li>
            <p>Charmberlain (garage automation)
<blockquote><p>Open the garage when you arrive, and Chamberlain can tell Nest you’re home. Close it on your way out, and your thermostat can go into Away mode so you don’t waste energy heating or cooling an empty home.</p></blockquote></p>
          </li>
          <li>IFTTT
<blockquote><p>Create your own connections with one simple statement – “if this then that.” For example, “If my Nest Protect detects smoke, then send a text message to my neighbors.”</p></blockquote></li>
          <li>Google
<blockquote><p>Just speak a command, “OK Google. Set the temperature to 75 degrees,” and your Nest Thermostat will do as you say. And with Google Now, you can be on your way home and your thermostat will start heating or cooling before you get there.</p></blockquote></li>

      <li>Dash has recently released upgrades including integration with <a href="http://ifttt.com">IFTTT</a> and an API for third-party developers.</li>
      <li>With IFTTT integration, users can build simple recipes that help link
their car’s data with other tools like Google, Facebook, Evernote, Dropbox, etc.
<blockquote><p>Designed for everything from fleet tracking to personal use, the first recipes include geo-fenced alerts, SMS alerts, Check Engine Light alerts, expense tracking, trip tracking, Do Not Disturb notifications (so you’re not bothered by incoming calls when driving), Google Glass integration, smart home integration, and more.</p></blockquote></li>

        <p>Other improvements</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>In addition, Dash’s core product is seeing a number of improvements and changes too, including increased access to real-time data from more data points and gauges, a trends section that shows your Dash score, fuel efficiency/MPG and driving miles over time, automated VIN decoding (which lets the app recognize what car you’re currently plugged into), integration with automotive info site Edmunds, Android tablet support, and added support for dozens of new OBD devices and car models.</p></p><p>        <p>Although Dash is now offering users more data to look through, the company is trying to balance that with a simplified interface, so it won’t be any more of a distraction to drivers than something like a radio or nav system.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>While Nokia had earlier released Nokia X, it was unclear if Microsoft 
approved of Nokia’s Android experiment.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Nokia had forked Android in February to create a new smartphone platform,
Nokia X platform.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>At the time Nokia described the fork as a Lumia “feeder” — with then CEO Stephen Elop saying Nokia X devices would be a Trojan horse within Google’s ecosystem by introducing first time smartphone owners to Microsoft’s services rather than Mountain View’s.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Specs 
        <ul>
          <li>1.2GHz dual-core Snapdragon processor</li>
          <li>1GB RAM</li>
          <li>5MP camera</li>
          <li>4.3” screen</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Processor and screen size are the primary improvements over the earlier <a href="http://www.nokia.com/global/products/nokia-x/">Nokia X</a></li>
      <li>Like Nokia X, this offers Windows like tile-based UI along with several
Microsoft/Nokia based Android apps like

    <ul>
      <li>Free OneDrive storage increased from 7GB to 15GB</li>
      <li>All versions of <a href="">Office 365</a> will now come with 1TB of space, instead
of the earlier 20GB. Prices have been slashed across plans as well.</li>
      <li>
        <p>With these changes, Microsoft seems to have ‘kicked off’ a productivity
war with Google.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“Anyone can do storage,” explains Microsoft’s head of OneDrive product management Angus Logan. “When you think of bringing in the productivity … that’s just something that Microsoft alone can deliver. No other company can deliver that.”<br/>…<br/>“When you think about productivity or authoring, Google is kind of the closest in terms of that, but I still think they’re far away,” notes Logan.<br/>…<br/>“We don’t really think of this as a storage price war,” explains Logan. “What we’re actually thinking about is a productivity war.”</p></blockquote></p>
