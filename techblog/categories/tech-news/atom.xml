    <p><a name="d-lang"></a> <strong><a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/07/d-programming-language/">The Next Big Programming Language you’ve never heard
of</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>D programming language got its name, although it was initially called Mars,
because it was seen as a successor of C++.</li>
      <li>It has been around for over 9 years and, unlike most new languages, has
recently picked up momentum.</li>
      <li>This can be attributed to Facebook deciding to experiment with the language.</li>
      <li>The language tries to bridge the gap between languages like C++ and Python,
i.e. the <em>fast</em> languages and <em>easy</em> languages.</li>
      <li>Andrei Alexandrescu, one of the authors of the language, is a research 
scientist at Facebook where his team is trying to rewrite small parts of the 
company using D. Walter Bright, the other author, is also collaborating 
on this project as an outside contractor.</li>
      <li>
        <p>Other languages that try to bridge the gap between the two kinds of languages
are <a href="https://code.google.com/p/go/">Google’s Go Programming Language</a> 
and <a href="https://developer.apple.com/swift/">Apple’s Swift</a></p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“D is similar to C++, but better,” says Brad Anderson, a longtime C++ programmer from Utah who has been using D as well. “It’s high performance, but it’s expressive. You can get a lot done without very much code.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Facebook is working on another language,
<a href="http://www.wired.com/2014/03/facebook-hack/">Hack</a>, which is also trying
to bridge this gap. Hack has been used at Facebook to replace the frontend
PHP code and can be seen as a new version of PHP itself. It allows
developers to use both static and dynamic typing, also called <a href="http://homes.soic.indiana.edu/jsiek/what-is-gradual-typing/">gradual
typing</a></li>
      <li>While Hack currently replaces only the front-end at Facebook, D is being 
experimented for backend processes. However, its authors intend D to be the
language of choice for all kinds of tasks.</li>
    </ul>

    <p><a name="phant"></a> <strong><a href="https://data.sparkfun.com/">Phant : A place to push your data</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://data.sparkfun.com/">data.sparkfun.com</a> powered by <a href="https://github.com/sparkfun/phant">Phant</a>,
provides a place to push your data streams. </li>
      <li>This allows developers to send data from any device to the server which stores
the data (up to 500MB, for free). </li>
      <li>This will help developers and hackers ignore the problems around data storage
and focus on applications that require several datapoints to be stored, shared
and analyzed.</li>
      <li>The idea is aimed at providing a platform to bring ‘Internet of things’ to
reality.</li>
      <li>
        <p>How does it work :</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>We thought data storage should be as easy as string concatenation. First, create a stream and you’ll receive a public url and a private key. Then, using the hardware of your choice (Ethernet shield, RasPi, BBB, Electric Imp, WiFly) simply create a string with the data you want to post.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>The underlying engine, Phant, is open-sourced and can be setup on any box,
giving developers control of their own data and allowing other such
services to pop-up.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Unlike wearables like FitBit, LifeTip doesn’t require to be in direct
contact with the skin or body. It hooks into a woman’s bra or a man’s shirt
and reads information like ECG (not just heart rate), calories burned and
steps taken by the user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The device is connected to a phone application using bluetooth, which
receives the data and can be used to provide insights into it.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Using capacitive technology, the device is able to measure all of these verticals without ever coming into contact with the skin, saving users from potential allergic reactions</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This project was recently launched on
<a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/lifetip-health-wearable-device-no-skin-contact-ecg-technology">Indiegogo</a>,
which is a platform like Kickstarter.</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Amazon launched <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/zocalo/">Zocalo</a> which is a ‘fully
managed, secure enterprise storage and sharing service with strong
administrative controls and feedback capabilities that improve user
productivity’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>It lets users “store, share, and gather feedback on documents,
spreadsheets, presentations, webpages, images, PDFs, or text files – from
the device of their choice.”</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By providing this service, Amazon has entered into the competition against
the likes of Box and Dropbox. Although there are several players in this 
segment, Amazon seems to be focusing on problems faced by users in using 
these services.</p>
      </li>
      <li>The focus lies on :-
        <ul>
          <li>Easy sharing</li>
          <li>Any device access</li>
          <li>Available with <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/workspaces/">Amazon WorkSpaces</a></li>
          <li>Simple Feedback</li>
          <li>Central file hub</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>The pricing is quite aggressive. Moreover, <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/zocalo/pricing/">WorkSpaces customers will get
access to Zocalo for free - including 50 GB of storage per WorkSpaces
user</a></li>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>The app links Google Glass with another head mounted hardware, the Neurosky
EEG biosensor, to create a communication loop</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The Neurosky biosensor picks up on brainwaves that correlate to your ability to focus. The app then translates these brainwaves into a meter reading that gets superimposed on the camera view in Google Glass. As you “focus” more with your mind, the meter goes up, and the app takes a photograph of what you are seeing in front of you. Focus some more, and the meter goes up again and the photo gets posted to Twitter.</p></blockquote></p>

which has been working on user interface.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Very early stages; clumsy prototype and not yet ready for production.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>The idea here is that this is a minimum viable product, a first step that can be developed further — for example, to create applications to “train” people to concentrate better, or to play games, maybe to help suggest places to get a coffee when your sensor picks up that you’re tired, or for medical applications, for example for people with mobility problems.</p></p><p>        <p>And potentially, you could build out the basic concept with more, lighter and easier-to-use sensors. This Place says that among those who have taken an interest are Stephen Hawking, the famous physicist who is nearly paralysed because of a progressive motor neuron disease.</p></blockquote></p>

Content
Previews</a></strong></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>On installing <a href="http://streamful.ly/">Streamfully</a> <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/streamfully/bemdobilmmplpepafjplfkeaaopppdef">Chrome Extension</a>,
every time the user hovers over a link, she can view a preview of the 
page which would contain snippets and images from the page.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The snippets are aimed to be user-specific, based on the content it deems 
relevant to the user. </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This could help user identify if the page in discussion contains information
she is looking for.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Pangaro [the creator] suggested that this moves web pages and articles away from being “giant containers” and makes the reading experience “more conversational” — in other words, more relevant to your interests, less repetitive (since Streamfully will focus on what’s unique about a piece of content and what it hasn’t shown you in other previews), and with more of a “dance and flow.”</p></p><p>        <p>And it necessarily mean it will be shallower experience, either — Pangaro said that by since it has lowered “the bio cost of looking” (i.e., the annoyance of clicking on a page and discovering that it isn’t what you were looking for), Streamfully might actually encourage users to spend more time with content once they know it’s a good fit.</p></blockquote></p>

Xiki plugins for Sublime and Vim will be created. The installer and initial user experience will be greatly improved (largely by adding contextual menus everywhere). The integration with the shell will be improved. To enable supporting new Xiki plugins, the core of Xiki will be refactored.

      <li>
        <p>The core idea of <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/">Inbox</a> is to help developers exploit email as a platform without the hassles of archaic 
protocols like IMAP and SMTP. </p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“I actually wrote my thesis at MIT on email tools, and discovered how difficult it was to add features to email apps,” explains Grinich [co-founded] of how Inbox came to be. “One big issue was the underlying plumbing – IMAP, MIME, character encodings, etc. – which is what Inbox fixes for developers.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Inbox provide <a href="https://www.inboxapp.com/docs">REST APIs</a> to retrieve, modify and send emails. It also provides APIs for complex tasks like 
custom filtering, accessing attachments, creating drafts, etc.</p>

The core team at Inbox also includes several other MIT alums, plus those with experience from Google and Firebase, as well as two graduates from the Parallel and Distributed Operating Systems group at MIT CSAIL, which spun out Meraki (acquired by Cisco).</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Carolina Healthcare Systems is buying credit-card data of its customers to be able to better predict the chances of them getting ill 
and provide them with relevant care and advice before that happens.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>By tracking expenses, they hope to be able to get insights into their habits. This can provide much more information than can be 
attained by the little time the doctor gets to assess a patient.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>For a patient with asthma, the hospital would be able to assess how likely he is to arrive at the emergency room by looking at whether he’s refilled his asthma medication at the pharmacy, has been buying cigarettes at the grocery store, and lives in an area with a high pollen count, Dulin says. The system may also look at the probability of someone having a heart attack by considering factors such as the type of foods she buys and if she has a gym membership. “The idea is to use Big Data and predictive models to think about population health and drill down to the individual levels,” he says.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While the supporters argue that such data is already used to targetted advertising and this is a much better use of the same information,
there are a lot of privacy concerns around the use of data for health tracking and unsolicited help.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>“It is one thing to have a number I can call if I have a problem or question; it is another thing to get unsolicited phone calls. I don’t like that,” says Jorjanne Murry, an accountant in Charlotte who has Type 1 diabetes and says she usually ignores calls from her health insurer trying to discuss her daily habits. “I think it is intrusive.”</p></blockquote></p>

        <p>The study</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were placed on Arabidopsis, a small flowering plant related to cabbage and mustard and the movement of the leaf in 
response to the chewing was measured and recorded, using a laser and a tiny piece of reflective material on the leaf of the plant.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Recordings of caterpillar feeding vibrations were played back to a set of plants, while only silence was played back on the other.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Caterpillars were later fed on these plants.</p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Findings</p>

        <ul>
          <li>The plants previously exposed to feeding vibrations produced more mustard oils, a chemical that is unappealing to many caterpillars.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><blockquote><p>“What is remarkable is that the plants exposed to different vibrations, including those made by a gentle wind or different insect sounds that share some acoustic features with caterpillar feeding vibrations did not increase their chemical defenses,” Cocroft said. “This indicates that the plants are able to distinguish feeding vibrations from other common sources of environmental vibration.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>How can it be used?</p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p><blockquote><p>“Caterpillars react to this chemical defense by crawling away, so using vibrations to enhance plant defenses could be useful to agriculture,” Appel said. “This research also opens the window of plant behavior a little wider, showing that plants have many of the same responses to outside influences that animals do, even though the responses look different.”</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>In a recently published study by Facebook : <a href="http://www.pnas.org/content/111/24/8788.full">Experimental evidence of
massive-scale emotional contagion through social
networks</a>, they disclosed
that for a week in 2012 they experimented with a set of ~700k English
speaking users, such that some had posts with negative emotions
deprioritized, while some had those with emotions deprioritized.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>The experiment was aimed at exploring the impact of the emotional nature
of the posts in the feed on the behavior and emotions of the user.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>This has caused a huge stir in the media and has raised questions about
the ethics of A/B testing.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While some argue that Facebook didn’t have the rights to perform such a
test, by accepting their terms and conditions we agree to let them use
our data in this form.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Moreover, this is not the first time a company has conducted an A/B test
on its users. While in most other cases, the tests are aimed at finding
the environment which gets the best returns, even they can be interpreted
as a ‘psychological experiment’.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Response by Facebook’s employee, Adam Kramer (one of the 
authors of the paper)</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>OK so. A lot of people have asked me about my and Jamie and Jeff’s recent study published in PNAS, and I wanted to give a brief public explanation. The reason we did this research is because we care about the emotional impact of Facebook and the people that use our product. We felt that it was important to investigate the common worry that seeing friends post positive content leads to people feeling negative or left out. At the same time, we were concerned that exposure to friends’ negativity might lead people to avoid visiting Facebook. We didn’t clearly state our motivations in the paper.</p></p><p>        <p>Regarding methodology, our research sought to investigate the above claim by very minimally deprioritizing a small percentage of content in News Feed (based on whether there was an emotional word in the post) for a group of people (about 0.04% of users, or 1 in 2500) for a short period (one week, in early 2012). Nobody’s posts were “hidden,” they just didn’t show up on some loads of Feed. Those posts were always visible on friends’ timelines, and could have shown up on subsequent News Feed loads. And we found the exact opposite to what was then the conventional wisdom: Seeing a certain kind of emotion (positive) encourages it rather than suppresses is.</p></p><p>        <p>And at the end of the day, the actual impact on people in the experiment was the minimal amount to statistically detect it — the result was that people produced an average of one fewer emotional word, per thousand words, over the following week.</p></p><p>        <p>The goal of all of our research at Facebook is to learn how to provide a better service. Having written and designed this experiment myself, I can tell you that our goal was never to upset anyone. I can understand why some people have concerns about it, and my coauthors and I are very sorry for the way the paper described the research and any anxiety it caused. In hindsight, the research benefits of the paper may not have justified all of this anxiety.</p></p><p>        <p>While we’ve always considered what research we do carefully, we (not just me, several other researchers at Facebook) have been working on improving our internal review practices. The experiment in question was run in early 2012, and we have come a long way since then. Those review practices will also incorporate what we’ve learned from the reaction to this paper</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>According to their study, there was a measurable, however small, impact
on the users and there was a network effect( those who felt more
negatively because of their feed shared negative feelings and passed on
the effect).</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>While it is unclear how severe the impact was, it would be disastrous for
Facebook’s reputation if it is discovered that their study resulted in
serious consequences.</p>

        <p>About Stuxnet </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>Back in June 2010, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet">Stuxnet</a>
was discovered and it was blamed for the decimation of Iranian
nuclear facilities.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Until <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2013/07/edward-snowden-u-s-israel-co-wrote-cyber-super-weapon-stuxnet/">Snowden confirmed the
suspicion</a>,
there were speculations that the worm was created by USA and Israel.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Stuxnet not only had the ability to jump inconspicuously from
computer to computer, until it founds its way into the nuclear
facilities’ network, but it could also mutate itself to avoid
detection.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>Once inside the required computers, it could manipulate motors at the
facilities to make the spin faster than they should and also ensure
that no alarm was raised because of it. </p>
          </li>
        </ul>

 <blockquote><p>… the Russian State Duma (parliament) passed the first bill requiring that the personal data of all Russians should be stored inside the country.</p></blockquote></p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>As a consequence of the bill, post September 2016, services like Facebook, Google or any international service would have to host 
their servers within Russian borders.
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, these non-Russian companies would not be allowed to send data outside the country unless they can provide certain guarantees on data storage inside the country. For those who do not, the state telecommunications agency Roskomnadzor will require carriers to restrict access to those services.</p></p><p>        <p>The bill also proposes amendments to laws covering personal information and data protection.</p></blockquote> </p>
      </li>
      <li>China is known to impose such restrictions on the Internet. While earlier it was seen as an opposition to free speech, now it can be
easily justified as a move to protect the data from evesdropping by NSA.</li>
      <li>Not only is this an indication of the tightening of regulations around the Internet around the world, but also how revelations of 
NSA’s snooping is affecting those regulations. Such regulations will severely impact the operations of the companies involved 
and could lead to further tougher laws restricting freedom of speech.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Google’s <a href="http://google.com/atap">Advanced Technology and Projects lab</a>
provided some interesting updates to <a href="http://projectara.com">Project Ara</a>
and <a href="https://www.google.com/atap/projecttango/#project">Project Tango</a></li>
      <li>Project Ara, that began as a concept called (and propogated by) <a href="https://phonebloks.com">PhoneBloks</a> aiming to create a smartphone with modular units
allowing for increased customization and longer life of phones.</li>
      <li>At Google I/O, <a href="http://mashable.com/2014/06/26/google-project-ara-prototype/">a prototype of a phone by Project Ara was unveiled</a>
<blockquote><p>When Eremenko brought the prototype on stage during a breakout session of Google I/O at San Francisco’s Moscone Center and flashed the Android bootup screen, the audience went wild. Ultimately, the phone failed to fully load (though the crowd cheered anyway), and Eremenko said plenty of challenges lie ahead for Ara, including the challenge of building the tech into a beautiful design for consumers.</p></blockquote></li>

He received a hearty round of applause when he generated a 3D replica of the stage in real time using Tango’s depth cameras. He also demonstrated a few games on the device, and at one point crouched to his knees to interact with a small virtual wizard on the screen.</p></blockquote></p>

      </li>
      <li>Installing it on iOS requires a jailbroken phone, however it can be 
installed on Android without any root privileges. </li>
      <li>The app was made by a Milan-based company, <a href="http://www.hackingteam.com/">Hacking Team</a>
that has made a niche for itself selling surveillance software to 
police in several countries.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>In Google I/O, it was announced that <a href="/techblog/2014/06/26/tech-news-google-io-keynote/#chromecast">Chromecast would allow anyone in
the same room to share the screen without requiring them to be on the
same wifi. </a> </li>
      <li>In a post keynote presentation, it was cleared up that this was achieved
using Ultrasonic soundwaves. </li>
      <li>Once configured, Chromecast will push uniquely generated ultrasonic
waves through the TV’s speakers encoding information required by the
phone to pair up.</li>
      <li>Apps using Chromecast SDK will listen for these ultrasounds (relying on
the phone’s microphone) to detect and show the option to pair up

      <li>Earlier this year, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/02/16/google-acquires-slicklogin-the-sound-based-password-alternative/">Google had acquired SlickLogin</a>, 
which used ultrasonic soundwaves to provide something like a 2-factor

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p><a href="https://github.com/micahflee/onionshare/blob/master/README.md">How does it work?</a></p>

        <p><blockquote><p>OnionShare lets you securely and anonymously share a file of any size with someone. It works by starting a web server, making it accessible as a Tor hidden service, and generating an unguessable URL to access and download the file. It doesn’t require setting up a server on the internet somewhere or using a third party filesharing service. You host the file on your own computer and use a Tor hidden service to make it temporarily accessible over the internet. The other user just needs to use Tor Browser to download the file from you.</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>If the file being sent is secret, one would want to use a secret
way to send over the aforementioned URL and <a href="https://pressfreedomfoundation.org/encryption-works#otr">Off-the-Record encrypted
chat</a> is
recommended for that.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="http://cleartax.in/">ClearTax</a>, founded in 2011 and based in Delhi,
already has a strong presence in India automating the income tax filing
process for workers.</li>
      <li>Over 300,00 people used ClearTax last year to file their taxes. </li>
      <li>First company to join YCombinator that focuses on only the Indian market.</li>
      <li>
        <p>It is not a typical <a href="http://ycombinator.com/">Y Combinator</a> launch</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>While their market opportunity is currently in India, ClearTax decided to join Y Combinator because the startup got access to “a set of resources we don’t get in India,” says founder Archit Gupta.</p></p><p>        <p>“We were missing some of the mentorship in India for example. I worked in Silicon Valley before. I was an engineer at Data Domain, which was acquired by EMC. So I had seen how being in the Valley is super useful, so that whole thing made it very, very clear to us that we should come out here.”</p></blockquote></p>
      </li>
      <li>Two of the cofounders, Anupam Mediratta and Archit Gupta, <a href="http://yourstory.com//2012/06/file-tax-online-cleartax/">graduated from
IIT Guwahati</a>,
while the third, RR Gupta, is a CA by profession with decades of
experience in taxation and accounting</li>
      <li>There are several companies in India that offer online tax services.</li>
      <li>
        <p>ClearTax, however, <a href="http://cleartax.in/Meta/Pricing">follows a freemium
model</a> where <a href="http://www.nextbigwhat.com/file-tax-returns-online-for-free-cleartax-297/">they can file their taxes
for free but pay to consult tax experts to get help on saving and
filing</a>.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>To use ClearTax, all someone needs to do is upload the form onto the website. Then ClearTax’s software automatically pulls out relevant data, so users don’t have to manually key in any numbers or information, and prepares tax forms for each user, a process the startup says can take as little as 15 minutes.<br/>Gupta says ClearTax’s main competitor is the government, which has its own online filing software, but that’s complicated to use, especially since people need to figure out which one out of seven tax forms they need to fill out</p></blockquote></p>

$1.2m in funding based on this app that sends across only a two letter

      <li>The two-and-half hour hackathon was an attempt to prove that Yo could 
do much more than just send ‘Yo’ across to friends.</li>
      <li>Using <a href="http://yoapi.justyo.co/">its API</a>, people tried to create several
apps. </li>
      <li>Apps developed during the hackathon :-
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.yoserverisdown.com/">YoServerIsDown</a> allows users to sign
up for this service which will send a ‘Yo’ whenever their server is

        <p>As we can see from the above ideas, <a href="http://techcrunch.com/2014/06/18/yo-yo/">‘Yo’ can meaning
anything</a>.</p>

        <p><blockquote><p>Venture investor (and husband of one of the world’s best-dressed billionaires) Marc Andreessen calls yo an example of one-bit communication – a message that only exists as itself. There is no meaning — the medium is, in fact, the message.</p></blockquote></p>
